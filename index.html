Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/warriordby/DepTR-MOT.

However, these modes are not fully adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4% performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across architectures.

While most existing trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies, resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion. Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions, strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations. These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1 FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains: compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and efficient solution for aerial object tracking.

MOT ensures consistent object identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS (MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic. Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization.

It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches. The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT. However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary. In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT. In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps. First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information. Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements. To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters.

However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking.

Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new 10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at: https://github.com/ngobibibnbe/uncertain-identity-aware-tracking

While existing hyperspectral trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules (SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI) module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs. Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2508.11531">Multi-State Tracker: Enhancing Efficient Object Tracking via Multi-State Specialization and Interaction</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG) and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD) design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Existing practices mix all data sensor types in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks, causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data, reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by 27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format, progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity. Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning, we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt. Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification performance.

However, existing methods primarily focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance.

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, the coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) dataset was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the foundations and insights of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces much greater scene complexity, including {more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), and scenarios requiring external knowledge.} We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops on MOSEv2. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and observe similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 poses challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite strong performance on existing datasets, current VOS methods still fall short under real-world complexities. Based on our analysis of the observed challenges, we further propose several practical tricks that enhance model performance. MOSEv2 is publicly available at https://MOSE.video.

Existing works either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then, we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object. In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20 baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task. Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural language generation strategy.

Existing methods can be roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training, showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules, including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results, and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate, their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.

However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{\tracker}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory (LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting a new benchmark in VIS.

Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components: Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance. Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at https://github.com/zhongjiaru/CoopTrack.

However, mainstream tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}: Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline, guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time running speeds.

The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking.

The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)} mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

In this paper, we introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across different model scales.

However, sensor synchronization challenges often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly, under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates. This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks, excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code and benchmark will be publicly available at https://github.com/supertyd/FlexTrack/tree/main.

Among them, pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information, non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution, the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33 videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the foundation models on our dataset.

Most of the existing approaches focus on learning target representation in well-conditioned daytime data, while for the unconstrained real-world scenarios with adverse weather conditions, e.g. nighttime or foggy environment, the tremendous domain shift leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose UMDATrack, which is capable of maintaining high-quality target state prediction under various adverse weather conditions within a unified domain adaptation framework. Specifically, we first use a controllable scenario generator to synthesize a small amount of unlabeled videos (less than 2% frames in source daytime datasets) in multiple weather conditions under the guidance of different text prompts. Afterwards, we design a simple yet effective domain-customized adapter (DCA), allowing the target objects' representation to rapidly adapt to various weather conditions without redundant model updating. Furthermore, to enhance the localization consistency between source and target domains, we propose a target-aware confidence alignment module (TCA) following optimal transport theorem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMDATrack can surpass existing advanced visual trackers and lead new state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin.

Specifically, we develop a simple but effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency, spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event tracking.

However, most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction, cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e., FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed tracking framework.

Building on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions, RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition, RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.

Moreover, appearance changes of the target caused by Doppler mismatch may lead to association failures and disrupt trajectory continuity. A major limitation in this field is the lack of public benchmark datasets for standardized algorithm evaluation. To address the above challenges, we collected and annotated 45 video SAR sequences containing moving targets, and named the Video SAR MOT Benchmark (VSMB). Specifically, to mitigate the effects of trailing and defocusing in moving targets, we introduce a line feature enhancement mechanism that emphasizes the positive role of motion shadows and reduces false alarms induced by static occlusions. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of target appearance variations, we propose a motion-aware clue discarding mechanism that substantially improves tracking robustness in Video SAR.

Despite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments continue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections, low-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent occlusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking Dataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically designed for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences, totaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object classes: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset captures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios, reflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated 14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed substantial performance degradation compared to their performance on general-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models demonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of domain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized tracking contexts. The MVTD dataset fills a critical gap in the visual tracking community by providing a realistic and challenging benchmark for maritime scenarios.

However, tracking in sports is challenging due to fast movements, occlusions, and camera shifts. Traditional tracking-by-detection methods require extensive tuning, while segmentation-based approaches struggle with track processing. We propose McByte, a tracking-by-detection framework that integrates temporally propagated segmentation mask as an association cue to improve robustness without per-video tuning. Unlike many existing methods, McByte does not require training, relying solely on pre-trained models and object detectors commonly used in the community. Evaluated on SportsMOT, DanceTrack, SoccerNet-tracking 2022 and MOT17, McByte demonstrates strong performance across sports and general pedestrian tracking.

Without using 3D features, they are ineffective in scenarios with occlusions or visually similar objects. To address this, our paper presents a novel depth-aware framework for MOT. We estimate depth using a zero-shot approach and incorporate it as an independent feature in the association process. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Alignment Score that refines IoU by integrating both coarse bounding box overlap and fine-grained (pixel-level) alignment to improve association accuracy without requiring additional learnable parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first MOT framework to incorporate 3D features (monocular depth) as an independent decision matrix in the association step. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks without any training nor fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/Milad-Khanchi/DepthMOT

To address this issue, this paper proposes for the first time a novel adversarial defense method based on denoise diffusion probabilistic models, termed DiffDf, aimed at effectively improving the robustness of existing visual tracking methods against adversarial attacks. DiffDf establishes a multi-scale defense mechanism by combining pixel-level reconstruction loss, semantic consistency loss, and structural similarity loss, effectively suppressing adversarial perturbations through a gradual denoising process. Extensive experimental results on several mainstream datasets show that the DiffDf method demonstrates excellent generalization performance for trackers with different architectures, significantly improving various evaluation metrics while achieving real-time inference speeds of over 30 FPS, showcasing outstanding defense performance and efficiency.

Traditional trackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex scenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic understanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning, suggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information; inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker introduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual branch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions derived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with semantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual representation. Experiments on six standard VOT benchmarks demonstrate that CLDTracker achieves SOTA performance, validating the effectiveness of leveraging robust and temporally-adaptive vision-language representations for tracking.

This requires mechanisms that can both identify semantically related objects across images and accurately produce segmentation masks. We note that Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), with its prompt-and-propagate mechanism, offers both strong segmentation capabilities and a built-in feature matching process. However, we show that its representations are entangled with task-specific cues optimized for object tracking, which impairs its use for tasks requiring higher level semantic understanding. Our key insight is that, despite its class-agnostic pretraining, SAM2 already encodes rich semantic structure in its features. We propose SANSA (Semantically AligNed Segment Anything 2), a framework that makes this latent structure explicit, and repurposes SAM2 for few-shot segmentation through minimal task-specific modifications. SANSA achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot segmentation benchmarks specifically designed to assess generalization, outperforms generalist methods in the popular in-context setting, supports various prompts flexible interaction via points, boxes, or scribbles, and remains significantly faster and more compact than prior approaches.

However, such frame-based methods inherently face challenges in achieving low-latency performance and often fail in resource-constrained environments. Visual object tracking using bio-inspired event cameras has emerged as a promising research direction in recent years, offering distinct advantages for low-latency applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Slow-Fast Tracking paradigm that flexibly adapts to different operational requirements, termed SFTrack. The proposed framework supports two complementary modes, i.e., a high-precision slow tracker for scenarios with sufficient computational resources, and an efficient fast tracker tailored for latency-aware, resource-constrained environments. Specifically, our framework first performs graph-based representation learning from high-temporal-resolution event streams, and then integrates the learned graph-structured information into two FlashAttention-based vision backbones, yielding the slow and fast trackers, respectively. The fast tracker achieves low latency through a lightweight network design and by producing multiple bounding box outputs in a single forward pass. Finally, we seamlessly combine both trackers via supervised fine-tuning and further enhance the fast tracker's performance through a knowledge distillation strategy. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks, including FE240, COESOT, and EventVOT, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method across different real-world scenarios.

However, the numerous security issues exposed by deep learning models have gradually affected the reliable application of visual tracking methods in real-world scenarios. Therefore, how to reveal the security vulnerabilities of existing visual trackers through effective adversarial attacks has become a critical problem that needs to be addressed. To this end, we propose an adaptive meta-gradient adversarial attack (AMGA) method for visual tracking. This method integrates multi-model ensembles and meta-learning strategies, combining momentum mechanisms and Gaussian smoothing, which can significantly enhance the transferability and attack effectiveness of adversarial examples. AMGA randomly selects models from a large model repository, constructs diverse tracking scenarios, and iteratively performs both white- and black-box adversarial attacks in each scenario, optimizing the gradient directions of each model. This paradigm minimizes the gap between white- and black-box adversarial attacks, thus achieving excellent attack performance in black-box scenarios. Extensive experimental results on large-scale datasets such as OTB2015, LaSOT, and GOT-10k demonstrate that AMGA significantly improves the attack performance, transferability, and deception of adversarial examples.

While the integration of hierarchical lightweight networks has become a prevalent strategy for enhancing efficiency in UAV tracking, it often results in a significant drop in network capacity, which further exacerbates challenges in UAV scenarios, such as frequent occlusions and extreme changes in viewing angles. To address these issues, we introduce a novel family of UAV trackers, termed CGTrack, which combines explicit and implicit techniques to expand network capacity within a coarse-to-fine framework. Specifically, we first introduce a Hierarchical Feature Cascade (HFC) module that leverages the spirit of feature reuse to increase network capacity by integrating the deep semantic cues with the rich spatial information, incurring minimal computational costs while enhancing feature representation. Based on this, we design a novel Lightweight Gated Center Head (LGCH) that utilizes gating mechanisms to decouple target-oriented coordinates from previously expanded features, which contain dense local discriminative information. Extensive experiments on three challenging UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate that CGTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while running fast.

The key strength of TbD lies in its modular design, enabling the integration of specialized off-the-shelf models like motion predictors and re-identification. However, the extensive usage of human-crafted rules for temporal associations makes these methods inherently limited in their ability to capture the complex interplay between various tracking cues. In this work, we introduce CAMEL, a novel association module for Context-Aware Multi-Cue ExpLoitation, that learns resilient association strategies directly from data, breaking free from hand-crafted heuristics while maintaining TbD's valuable modularity. At its core, CAMEL employs two transformer-based modules and relies on a novel association-centric training scheme to effectively model the complex interactions between tracked targets and their various association cues. Unlike end-to-end detection-by-tracking approaches, our method remains lightweight and fast to train while being able to leverage external off-the-shelf models. Our proposed online tracking pipeline, CAMELTrack, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple tracking benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/TrackingLaboratory/CAMELTrack.

The system integrates memory-augmented task planning, enabling robots to execute high-level user commands while tracking past actions. It employs three specialized agents: a routing agent, a task planning agent, and a knowledge base agent, each powered by task-specific LLMs. By leveraging in-context learning, our system avoids the need for explicit model training. RAG enables the system to retrieve context from past interactions, enhancing long-term object tracking. A combination of Grounded SAM and LLaMa3.2-Vision provides robust object detection, facilitating semantic scene understanding for task planning. Evaluation across three household scenarios demonstrates high task planning accuracy and an improvement in memory recall due to RAG. Specifically, Qwen2.5 yields best performance for specialized agents, while LLaMA3.1 excels in routing tasks. The source code is available at: https://github.com/marc1198/chat-hsr.

However, it remains a significant challenge in monocular setups due to the difficulty of mining 3D spatiotemporal associations from 2D video streams. In this work, we present three innovative techniques to enhance the fusion and exploitation of heterogeneous cues for monocular 3D MOT: (1) we introduce the Hungarian State Space Model (HSSM), a novel data association mechanism that compresses contextual tracking cues across multiple paths, enabling efficient and comprehensive assignment decisions with linear complexity. HSSM features a global receptive field and dynamic weights, in contrast to traditional linear assignment algorithms that rely on hand-crafted association costs. (2) We propose Fully Convolutional One-stage Embedding (FCOE), which eliminates ROI pooling by directly using dense feature maps for contrastive learning, thus improving object re-identification accuracy under challenging conditions such as varying viewpoints and lighting. (3) We enhance 6-DoF pose estimation through VeloSSM, an encoder-decoder architecture that models temporal dependencies in velocity to capture motion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of frame-based 3D inference. Experiments on the KITTI public test benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance of 76.86~HOTA at 31~FPS. Our approach outperforms the previous best by significant margins of +2.63~HOTA and +3.62~AssA, showcasing its robustness and efficiency for monocular 3D MOT tasks.

When underwater visibility is insufficient, only sonar systems can provide stable data, which necessitates exploration of the underwater acoustic object tracking (UAOT) task. Previous studies have explored traditional methods and Siamese networks for UAOT. However, the absence of a unified evaluation benchmark has significantly constrained the value of these methods. To alleviate this limitation, we propose the first large-scale UAOT benchmark, SonarT165, comprising 165 square sequences, 165 fan sequences, and 205K high-quality annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that SonarT165 reveals limitations in current state-of-the-art SOT trackers. To address these limitations, we propose STFTrack, an efficient framework for acoustic object tracking. It includes two novel modules, a multi-view template fusion module (MTFM) and an optimal trajectory correction module (OTCM). The MTFM module integrates multi-view feature of both the original image and the binary image of the dynamic template, and introduces a cross-attention-like layer to fuse the spatio-temporal target representations. The OTCM module introduces the acoustic-response-equivalent pixel property and proposes normalized pixel brightness response scores, thereby suppressing suboptimal matches caused by inaccurate Kalman filter prediction boxes. To further improve the model feature, STFTrack introduces a acoustic image enhancement method and a Frequency Enhancement Module (FEM) into its tracking pipeline. Comprehensive experiments show the proposed STFTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/LiYunfengLYF/SonarT165.

Among various approaches, robust visual tracking that combines RGB frames with Event streams has attracted increasing attention from researchers. While striving for high accuracy and efficiency in tracking, it is also important to explore how to effectively conduct adversarial attacks and defenses on RGB-Event stream tracking algorithms, yet research in this area remains relatively scarce. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a cross-modal adversarial attack algorithm for RGB-Event visual tracking. Because of the diverse representations of Event streams, and given that Event voxels and frames are more commonly used, this paper will focus on these two representations for an in-depth study. Specifically, for the RGB-Event voxel, we first optimize the perturbation by adversarial loss to generate RGB frame adversarial examples. For discrete Event voxel representations, we propose a two-step attack strategy, more in detail, we first inject Event voxels into the target region as initialized adversarial examples, then, conduct a gradient-guided optimization by perturbing the spatial location of the Event voxels. For the RGB-Event frame based tracking, we optimize the cross-modal universal perturbation by integrating the gradient information from multimodal data. We evaluate the proposed approach against attacks on three widely used RGB-Event Tracking datasets, i.e., COESOT, FE108, and VisEvent. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces the performance of the tracker across numerous datasets in both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

Previous works typically train the whole process end-to-end or integrate an additional referring text module into a multi-object tracker, but they both require supervised training and potentially struggle with generalization to open-set queries. In this work, we introduce ReferGPT, a novel zero-shot referring multi-object tracking framework. We provide a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with spatial knowledge enabling it to generate 3D-aware captions. This enhances its descriptive capabilities and supports a more flexible referring vocabulary without training. We also propose a robust query-matching strategy, leveraging CLIP-based semantic encoding and fuzzy matching to associate MLLM generated captions with user queries. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI, Refer-KITTIv2 and Refer-KITTI+ demonstrate that ReferGPT achieves competitive performance against trained methods, showcasing its robustness and zero-shot capabilities in autonomous driving.

To extend this to multi-object tracking (MOT), we propose SAM2MOT, introducing a novel Tracking by Segmentation paradigm. Unlike Tracking by Detection or Tracking by Query, SAM2MOT directly generates tracking boxes from segmentation masks, reducing reliance on detection accuracy. SAM2MOT has two key advantages: zero-shot generalization, allowing it to work across datasets without fine-tuning, and strong object association, inherited from SAM2. To further improve performance, we integrate a trajectory manager system for precise object addition and removal, and a cross-object interaction module to handle occlusions. Experiments on DanceTrack, UAVDT, and BDD100K show state-of-the-art results.

However, most of the existing VL trackers rely on carefully designed mechanisms to perform the multi-stage multi-modal fusion. Additionally, direct multi-modal fusion without alignment ignores distribution discrepancy between modalities in feature space, potentially leading to suboptimal representations. In this work, we propose COST, a contrastive one-stage transformer fusion framework for VL tracking, aiming to learn semantically consistent and unified VL representations. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive alignment strategy that maximizes mutual information (MI) between a video and its corresponding language description. This enables effective cross-modal alignment, yielding semantically consistent features in the representation space. By leveraging a visual-linguistic transformer, we establish an efficient multi-modal fusion and reasoning mechanism, empirically demonstrating that a simple stack of transformer encoders effectively enables unified VL representations. Moreover, we contribute a newly collected VL tracking benchmark dataset for small object tracking, named VL-SOT500, with bounding boxes and language descriptions. Our dataset comprises two challenging subsets, VL-SOT230 and VL-SOT270, dedicated to evaluating generic and high-speed small object tracking, respectively. Small object tracking is notoriously challenging due to weak appearance and limited features, and this dataset is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to explore the usage of language cues to enhance visual representation for small object tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COST achieves state-of-the-art performance on five existing VL tracking datasets, as well as on our proposed VL-SOT500 dataset. Source codes and dataset will be made publicly available.

However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications.

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

However, existing datasets and methodologies primarily target mainstream team sports such as soccer and conventional 5-on-5 basketball, often overlooking scenarios involving fixed-camera setups commonly used at amateur levels, less mainstream sports, or datasets that explicitly incorporate pose annotations. In this paper, we propose the TrackID3x3 dataset, the first publicly available comprehensive dataset specifically designed for multi-player tracking, player identification, and pose estimation in 3x3 basketball scenarios. The dataset comprises three distinct subsets (Indoor fixed-camera, Outdoor fixed-camera, and Drone camera footage), capturing diverse full-court camera perspectives and environments. We also introduce the Track-ID task, a simplified variant of the game state reconstruction task that excludes field detection and focuses exclusively on fixed-camera scenarios. To evaluate performance, we propose a baseline algorithm called Track-ID algorithm, tailored to assess tracking and identification quality. Furthermore, our benchmark experiments, utilizing recent multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., BoT-SORT-ReID) and top-down pose estimation methods (HRNet, RTMPose, and SwinPose), demonstrate robust results and highlight remaining challenges. Our dataset and evaluation benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing automated analytics in 3x3 basketball.

To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale Multispectral UAV Single Object Tracking dataset (MUST), which includes 250 video sequences spanning diverse environments and challenges, providing a comprehensive data foundation for multispectral UAV tracking. We also propose a novel tracking framework, UNTrack, which encodes unified spectral, spatial, and temporal features from spectrum prompts, initial templates, and sequential searches. UNTrack employs an asymmetric transformer with a spectral background eliminate mechanism for optimal relationship modeling and an encoder that continuously updates the spectrum prompt to refine tracking, improving both accuracy and efficiency.

Despite the substantial progress, most of the existing approaches tackle object tracking as a deterministic coordinate regression problem, while the target localization uncertainty has been greatly overlooked, which hampers trackers' ability to maintain reliable target state prediction in challenging scenarios. To address this issue, we propose UncTrack, a novel uncertainty-aware transformer tracker that predicts the target localization uncertainty and incorporates this uncertainty information for accurate target state inference. Specifically, UncTrack utilizes a transformer encoder to perform feature interaction between template and search images. The output features are passed into an uncertainty-aware localization decoder (ULD) to coarsely predict the corner-based localization and the corresponding localization uncertainty. Then the localization uncertainty is sent into a prototype memory network (PMN) to excavate valuable historical information to identify whether the target state prediction is reliable or not. To enhance the template representation, the samples with high confidence are fed back into the prototype memory bank for memory updating, making the tracker more robust to challenging appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ManOfStory/UncTrack.

Generally, this process is carried out in two steps: detecting objects and associating them across frames based on various cues and metrics. Many studies and applications adopt object appearance, also known as re-identification (ReID) features, for target matching through straightforward similarity calculation. However, we argue that this practice is overly naive and thus overlooks the unique characteristics of MOT tasks. Unlike regular re-identification tasks that strive to distinguish all potential targets in a general representation, multi-object tracking typically immerses itself in differentiating similar targets within the same video sequence. Therefore, we believe that seeking a more suitable feature representation space based on the different sample distributions of each sequence will enhance tracking performance. In this paper, we propose using history-aware transformations on ReID features to achieve more discriminative appearance representations. Specifically, we treat historical trajectory features as conditions and employ a tailored Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) to find a spatial projection matrix that maximizes the differentiation between different trajectories. Our extensive experiments reveal that this training-free projection can significantly boost feature-only trackers to achieve competitive, even superior tracking performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while also demonstrating impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal and further encourages future investigation into the importance and customization of ReID models in multiple object tracking.

In particular, when visual tracking encounters errors, the optimized bias results may deviate significantly from the true values, adversely impacting the system's stability and localization precision. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play framework featuring the Inertial Prior Network (IPNet), which is designed to accurately estimate IMU bias. Recognizing the substantial impact of initial bias errors in low-cost inertial devices on system performance, our network directly leverages raw IMU data to estimate the mean bias, eliminating the dependency on historical estimates in traditional recursive predictions and effectively preventing error propagation. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative approach to calculate the mean value of the bias for network training, addressing the lack of bias labels in many visual-inertial datasets. The framework is evaluated on two public datasets and one self-collected dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both localization precision and robustness, with the ATE-RMSE metric improving on average by 46\%.

However, challenges such as small object sizes, ambiguous features, and limited generalization make it difficult for current methods to achieve this goal. In this work, we propose ROS-SAM, a method designed to achieve high-quality interactive segmentation while preserving generalization across diverse remote sensing data. The ROS-SAM is built upon three key innovations: 1) LoRA-based fine-tuning, which enables efficient domain adaptation while maintaining SAM's generalization ability, 2) Enhancement of deep network layers to improve the discriminability of extracted features, thereby reducing misclassifications, and 3) Integration of global context with local boundary details in the mask decoder to generate high-quality segmentation masks. Additionally, we design the data pipeline to ensure the model learns to better handle objects at varying scales during training while focusing on high-quality predictions during inference. Experiments on remote sensing video datasets show that the redesigned data pipeline boosts the IoU by 6%, while ROS-SAM increases the IoU by 13%. Finally, when evaluated on existing remote sensing object tracking datasets, ROS-SAM demonstrates impressive zero-shot capabilities, generating masks that closely resemble manual annotations. These results confirm ROS-SAM as a powerful tool for fine-grained segmentation in remote sensing applications. Code is available at https://github.com/ShanZard/ROS-SAM.

However, the existing open-vocabulary tracker is constrained by its framework structure, isolated frame-level perception, and insufficient modal interactions, which hinder its performance in open-vocabulary classification and tracking. In this paper, we propose OVTR (End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with TRansformer), the first end-to-end open-vocabulary tracker that models motion, appearance, and category simultaneously. To achieve stable classification and continuous tracking, we design the CIP (Category Information Propagation) strategy, which establishes multiple high-level category information priors for subsequent frames. Additionally, we introduce a dual-branch structure for generalization capability and deep multimodal interaction, and incorporate protective strategies in the decoder to enhance performance. Experimental results show that our method surpasses previous trackers on the open-vocabulary MOT benchmark while also achieving faster inference speeds and significantly reducing preprocessing requirements. Moreover, the experiment transferring the model to another dataset demonstrates its strong adaptability. Models and code are released at https://github.com/jinyanglii/OVTR.

Traditional camera-based perception tasks like 3D object tracking and semantic occupancy prediction lack either spatial comprehensiveness or temporal consistency. In this work, we introduce a brand-new task, Camera-based 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking, which simultaneously addresses panoptic occupancy segmentation and object tracking from camera-only input. Furthermore, we propose TrackOcc, a cutting-edge approach that processes image inputs in a streaming, end-to-end manner with 4D panoptic queries to address the proposed task. Leveraging the localization-aware loss, TrackOcc enhances the accuracy of 4D panoptic occupancy tracking without bells and whistles.

However, complete ViT architectures are too cumbersome to deploy for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking which extremely emphasizes efficiency. In this study, we discover that many layers within lightweight ViT-based trackers tend to learn relatively redundant and repetitive target representations. Based on this observation, we propose a similarity-guided layer adaptation approach to optimize the structure of ViTs. Our approach dynamically disables a large number of representation-similar layers and selectively retains only a single optimal layer among them, aiming to achieve a better accuracy-speed trade-off. By incorporating this approach into existing ViTs, we tailor previously complete ViT architectures into an efficient similarity-guided layer-adaptive framework, namely SGLATrack, for real-time UAV tracking. Extensive experiments on six tracking benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and show that our SGLATrack achieves a state-of-the-art real-time speed while maintaining competitive tracking precision.

However, most MOT algorithms are tailored for pinhole images with limited views, impairing their effectiveness in panoramic settings. Additionally, panoramic image distortions, such as resolution loss, geometric deformation, and uneven lighting, hinder direct adaptation of existing MOT methods, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose OmniTrack, an omnidirectional MOT framework that incorporates Tracklet Management to introduce temporal cues, FlexiTrack Instances for object localization and association, and the CircularStatE Module to alleviate image and geometric distortions. This integration enables tracking in panoramic field-of-view scenarios, even under rapid sensor motion. To mitigate the lack of panoramic MOT datasets, we introduce the QuadTrack dataset--a comprehensive panoramic dataset collected by a quadruped robot, featuring diverse challenges such as panoramic fields of view, intense motion, and complex environments. Extensive experiments on the public JRDB dataset and the newly introduced QuadTrack benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework. OmniTrack achieves a HOTA score of 26.92% on JRDB, representing an improvement of 3.43%, and further achieves 23.45% on QuadTrack, surpassing the baseline by 6.81%.

Most tracking systems have limitations such as constraining all movement to a 2D plane and they often track only one object. In this paper, we present a new modular pipeline that calculates 3D trajectories of multiple objects. It is adaptable to various settings where multiple time-synced and stationary cameras record moving objects, using off the shelf webcams. Our pipeline was tested on the Table Setting Dataset, where participants are recorded with various sensors as they set a table with tableware objects. We need to track these manipulated objects, using 6 rgb webcams. Challenges include: Detecting small objects in 9.874.699 camera frames, determining camera poses, discriminating between nearby and overlapping objects, temporary occlusions, and finally calculating a 3D trajectory using the right subset of an average of 11.12.456 pixel coordinates per 3-minute trial. We implement a robust pipeline that results in accurate trajectories with covariance of x,y,z-position as a confidence metric. It deals dynamically with appearing and disappearing objects, instantiating new Extended Kalman Filters. It scales to hundreds of table-setting trials with very little human annotation input, even with the camera poses of each trial unknown.

Current efficient trackers mainly follow precision-oriented trackers, adopting a one-stream framework with lightweight modules. However, blindly adhering to the one-stream paradigm may not be optimal, as incorporating template computation in every frame leads to redundancy, and pervasive semantic interaction between template and search region places stress on edge devices. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric Siamese tracker named \textbf{AsymTrack} for efficient tracking. AsymTrack disentangles template and search streams into separate branches, with template computing only once during initialization to generate modulation signals. Building on this architecture, we devise an efficient template modulation mechanism to unidirectional inject crucial cues into the search features, and design an object perception enhancement module that integrates abstract semantics and local details to overcome the limited representation in lightweight tracker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsymTrack offers superior speed-precision trade-offs across different platforms compared to the current state-of-the-arts. For instance, AsymTrack-T achieves 60.8\% AUC on LaSOT and 224/81/84 FPS on GPU/CPU/AGX, surpassing HiT-Tiny by 6.0\% AUC with higher speeds.

However, existing unified RGB-X trackers (X represents depth, event, or thermal modality) either rely on the task-specific training strategy for individual RGB-X image pairs or fail to address the critical importance of modality-adaptive perception in real-world applications. In this work, we propose UASTrack, a unified adaptive selection framework that facilitates both model and parameter unification, as well as adaptive modality discrimination across various multi-modal tracking tasks. To achieve modality-adaptive perception in joint RGB-X pairs, we design a Discriminative Auto-Selector (DAS) capable of identifying modality labels, thereby distinguishing the data distributions of auxiliary modalities. Furthermore, we propose a Task-Customized Optimization Adapter (TCOA) tailored to various modalities in the latent space. This strategy effectively filters noise redundancy and mitigates background interference based on the specific characteristics of each modality. Extensive comparisons conducted on five benchmarks including LasHeR, GTOT, RGBT234, VisEvent, and DepthTrack, covering RGB-T, RGB-E, and RGB-D tracking scenarios, demonstrate our innovative approach achieves comparative performance by introducing only additional training parameters of 1.87M and flops of 1.95G.

Recent years have seen rapid development in the field of multi-object tracking. However, due to the lack of datasets and the high cost of annotations, multi-object tracking under low-light environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we focus on multi-object tracking under low-light conditions. To address the issues of limited data and the lack of dataset, we first constructed a low-light multi-object tracking dataset (LLMOT). This dataset comprises data from MOT17 that has been enhanced for nighttime conditions as well as multiple unannotated low-light videos. Subsequently, to tackle the high annotation costs and address the issue of image quality degradation, we propose a semi-supervised multi-object tracking method based on consistency regularization named CRTrack. First, we calibrate a consistent adaptive sampling assignment to replace the static IoU-based strategy, enabling the semi-supervised tracking method to resist noisy pseudo-bounding boxes. Then, we design a adaptive semi-supervised network update method, which effectively leverages unannotated data to enhance model performance. Dataset and Code: https://github.com/ZJZhao123/CRTrack.

Existing 3D MOT methods based on the Tracking-by-Detection framework typically use a single motion model to track an object throughout its entire tracking process. However, objects may change their motion patterns due to variations in the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce the Interacting Multiple Model filter in IMM-MOT, which accurately fits the complex motion patterns of individual objects, overcoming the limitation of single-model tracking in existing approaches. In addition, we incorporate a Damping Window mechanism into the trajectory lifecycle management, leveraging the continuous association status of trajectories to control their creation and termination, reducing the occurrence of overlooked low-confidence true targets. Furthermore, we propose the Distance-Based Score Enhancement module, which enhances the differentiation between false positives and true positives by adjusting detection scores, thereby improving the effectiveness of the Score Filter. On the NuScenes Val dataset, IMM-MOT outperforms most other single-modal models using 3D point clouds, achieving an AMOTA of 73.8%. Our project is available at https://github.com/Ap01lo/IMM-MOT.

Currently, tracking-by-detection (TBD) is the dominant paradigm for MOT, which performs target detection and association frame by frame. However, the association performance of TBD methods degrades in complex scenes with heavy occlusions, which hinders the application of such methods in real-world scenarios.To this end, we incorporate pseudo-depth cues to enhance the association performance and propose Pseudo-Depth SORT (PD-SORT). First, we extend the Kalman filter state vector with pseudo-depth states. Second, we introduce a novel depth volume IoU (DVIoU) by combining the conventional 2D IoU with pseudo-depth. Furthermore, we develop a quantized pseudo-depth measurement (QPDM) strategy for more robust data association. Besides, we also integrate camera motion compensation (CMC) to handle dynamic camera situations. With the above designs, PD-SORT significantly alleviates the occlusion-induced ambiguous associations and achieves leading performances on DanceTrack, MOT17, and MOT20. Note that the improvement is especially obvious on DanceTrack, where objects show complex motions, similar appearances, and frequent occlusions.

We present SST-EM (Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal Evaluation Metric), a novel evaluation framework that leverages modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Object Detection, and Temporal Consistency checks. SST-EM comprises four components: (1) semantic extraction from frames using a VLM, (2) primary object tracking with Object Detection, (3) focused object refinement via an LLM agent, and (4) temporal consistency assessment using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These components are integrated into a unified metric with weights derived from human evaluations and regression analysis.

However, forestry operations such as harvesting, handling and measuring logs still require substantial human labor in remote environments posing significant safety risks. Progressively automating these tasks has the potential of increasing their efficiency as well as safety, but requires an accurate detection of individual logs as well as live trees and their context. Although initial approaches have been proposed for this challenging application domain, specialized data and algorithms are still too scarce to develop robust solutions. To mitigate this gap, we introduce the TimberVision dataset, consisting of more than 2k annotated RGB images containing a total of 51k trunk components including cut and lateral surfaces, thereby surpassing any existing dataset in this domain in terms of both quantity and detail by a large margin. Based on this data, we conduct a series of ablation experiments for oriented object detection and instance segmentation and evaluate the influence of multiple scene parameters on model performance. We introduce a generic framework to fuse the components detected by our models for both tasks into unified trunk representations. Furthermore, we automatically derive geometric properties and apply multi-object tracking to further enhance robustness. Our detection and tracking approach provides highly descriptive and accurate trunk representations solely from RGB image data, even under challenging environmental conditions. Our solution is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios and can be readily combined with other sensor modalities.

Traditional statistical model-based tracking methods rely on predefined motion models and assumptions about system noise distributions. Although computationally efficient, they often lack adaptability to varying traffic scenarios and require extensive manual design and parameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D multi-object tracking approach for vehicles, HybridTrack, which integrates a data-driven Kalman Filter (KF) within a tracking-by-detection paradigm. In particular, it learns the transition residual and Kalman gain directly from data, which eliminates the need for manual motion and stochastic parameter modeling. Validated on the real-world KITTI dataset, HybridTrack achieves 82.72% HOTA accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate our method under different configurations, achieving the fastest processing speed of 112 FPS. Consequently, HybridTrack eliminates the dependency on scene-specific designs while improving performance and maintaining real-time efficiency.

In addition, we propose AVTrack-MD, an enhanced tracker incorporating a novel MI maximization-based multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework.

Its task form is to guide the tracker to track objects that match the language description. Current research mainly focuses on referring multi-object tracking under single-view, which refers to a view sequence or multiple unrelated view sequences. However, in the single-view, some appearances of objects are easily invisible, resulting in incorrect matching of objects with the language description. In this work, we propose a new task, called Cross-view Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CRMOT). It introduces the cross-view to obtain the appearances of objects from multiple views, avoiding the problem of the invisible appearances of objects in RMOT task. CRMOT is a more challenging task of accurately tracking the objects that match the language description and maintaining the identity consistency of objects in each cross-view. To advance CRMOT task, we construct a cross-view referring multi-object tracking benchmark based on CAMPUS and DIVOTrack datasets, named CRTrack. Specifically, it provides 13 different scenes and 221 language descriptions. Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end cross-view referring multi-object tracking method, named CRTracker. Extensive experiments on the CRTrack benchmark verify the effectiveness of our method. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/chen-si-jia/CRMOT.

However, existing multimodal trackers mainly focus on the fusion and enhancement of spatial features or merely leverage the sparse temporal relationships between video frames. These approaches do not fully exploit the temporal correlations in multimodal videos, making it difficult to capture the dynamic changes and motion information of targets in complex scenarios. To alleviate this problem, we propose a unified multimodal spatial-temporal tracking approach named STTrack. In contrast to previous paradigms that solely relied on updating reference information, we introduced a temporal state generator (TSG) that continuously generates a sequence of tokens containing multimodal temporal information. These temporal information tokens are used to guide the localization of the target in the next time state, establish long-range contextual relationships between video frames, and capture the temporal trajectory of the target. Furthermore, at the spatial level, we introduced the mamba fusion and background suppression interactive (BSI) modules. These modules establish a dual-stage mechanism for coordinating information interaction and fusion between modalities. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets illustrate that STTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across various multimodal tracking scenarios.

However, prior work has focused evaluations on semantic-related tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ action classification, ImageNet classification, etc. In this paper we focus on evaluating self-supervised learning on non-semantic vision tasks that are more spatial (3D) and temporal (+1D = 4D), such as camera pose estimation, point and object tracking, and depth estimation. We show that by learning from very large video datasets, masked auto-encoding (MAE) with transformer video models actually scales, consistently improving performance on these 4D tasks, as model size increases from 20M all the way to the largest by far reported self-supervised video model $\unicode{x2013}$ 22B parameters. Rigorous apples-to-apples comparison with many recent image and video models demonstrates the benefits of scaling 4D representations.

However, existing methods typically use only a few tokens to convey this information, which can lead to information loss and limit their ability to fully capture the context. To address this issue, we propose a new video-level visual object tracking framework called MCITrack. It leverages Mamba's hidden states to continuously record and transmit extensive contextual information throughout the video stream, resulting in more robust object tracking. The core component of MCITrack is the Contextual Information Fusion module, which consists of the mamba layer and the cross-attention layer. The mamba layer stores historical contextual information, while the cross-attention layer integrates this information into the current visual features of each backbone block. This module enhances the model's ability to capture and utilize contextual information at multiple levels through deep integration with the backbone. Experiments demonstrate that MCITrack achieves competitive performance across numerous benchmarks. For instance, it gets 76.6% AUC on LaSOT and 80.0% AO on GOT-10k, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Code and models are available at https://github.com/kangben258/MCITrack.

Existing multi-object tracking algorithms generally focus on single-modality scenes, and overlook the complementary characteristics of tiny objects captured by multiple remote sensors. To enhance tracking performance by integrating complementary information from multiple sources, we propose a novel framework called {HGT-Track (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer based Multi-Tiny-Object Tracking)}. Specifically, we first employ a Transformer-based encoder to embed images from different modalities. Subsequently, we utilize Heterogeneous Graph Transformer to aggregate spatial and temporal information from multiple modalities to generate detection and tracking features. Additionally, we introduce a target re-detection module (ReDet) to ensure tracklet continuity by maintaining consistency across different modalities. Furthermore, this paper introduces the first benchmark VT-Tiny-MOT (Visible-Thermal Tiny Multi-Object Tracking) for RGB-T fused multiple tiny object tracking. Extensive experiments are conducted on VT-Tiny-MOT, and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in terms of MOTA (Multiple-Object Tracking Accuracy) and ID-F1 score.

As segmentation foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) begin to emerge, zero-shot segmentation requires only minimal human participation obtaining high-quality object masks. We introduce a HoloLens-Object-Labeling (HOLa) Unity and Python application based on the SAM-Track algorithm that offers fully automatic single object annotation for HoloLens 2 while requiring minimal human participation. HOLa does not have to be adjusted to a specific image appearance and could thus alleviate AR research in any application field. We evaluate HOLa for different degrees of image complexity in open liver surgery and in medical phantom experiments. Using HOLa for image annotation can increase the labeling speed by more than 500 times while providing Dice scores between 0.875 and 0.982, which are comparable to human annotators.

Specifically, GSOT3D offers 620 sequences with 123K frames, and covers a wide selection of 54 object categories. Each sequence is offered with multiple modalities, including the point cloud (PC), RGB image, and depth. This allows GSOT3D to support various 3D tracking tasks, such as single-modal 3D SOT on PC and multi-modal 3D SOT on RGB-PC or RGB-D, and thus greatly broadens research directions for 3D object tracking. To provide highquality per-frame 3D annotations, all sequences are labeled manually with multiple rounds of meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, GSOT3D is the largest benchmark dedicated to various generic 3D object tracking tasks. To understand how existing 3D trackers perform and to provide comparisons for future research on GSOT3D, we assess eight representative point cloud-based tracking models. Our evaluation results exhibit that these models heavily degrade on GSOT3D, and more efforts are required for robust and generic 3D object tracking. Besides, to encourage future research, we present a simple yet effective generic 3D tracker, named PROT3D, that localizes the target object via a progressive spatial-temporal network and outperforms all current solutions by a large margin. By releasing GSOT3D, we expect to advance further 3D tracking in future research and applications.

Within ITS, answering complex, real-time queries like "How many red cars passed in the last 10 minutes?" or "Was there an incident between 3:00 PM and 3:05 PM?" enhances situational awareness and decision-making. Despite progress in vision-language models, VideoQA remains challenging, especially in dynamic environments involving multiple objects and intricate spatiotemporal relationships. This study evaluates state-of-the-art VideoQA models using non-benchmark synthetic and real-world traffic sequences. The framework leverages GPT-4o to assess accuracy, relevance, and consistency across basic detection, temporal reasoning, and decomposition queries. VideoLLaMA-2 excelled with 57% accuracy, particularly in compositional reasoning and consistent answers. However, all models, including VideoLLaMA-2, faced limitations in multi-object tracking, temporal coherence, and complex scene interpretation, highlighting gaps in current architectures. These findings underscore VideoQA's potential in traffic monitoring but also emphasize the need for improvements in multi-object tracking, temporal reasoning, and compositional capabilities. Enhancing these areas could make VideoQA indispensable for incident detection, traffic flow management, and responsive urban planning.

While already achieving top performance on many benchmarks, it was the recent release of SAM2 that placed memory-based trackers into focus of the visual object tracking community. Nevertheless, modern trackers still struggle in the presence of distractors. We argue that a more sophisticated memory model is required, and propose a new distractor-aware memory model for SAM2 and an introspection-based update strategy that jointly addresses the segmentation accuracy as well as tracking robustness. The resulting tracker is denoted as SAM2.1++. We also propose a new distractor-distilled DiDi dataset to study the distractor problem better. SAM2.1++ outperforms SAM2.1 and related SAM memory extensions on seven benchmarks and sets a solid new state-of-the-art on six of them.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) typically treat all regions of an image equally, which can lead to inefficient feature extraction. To address this challenge, I have introduced Vision Eagle Attention, a novel attention mechanism that enhances visual feature extraction using convolutional spatial attention. The model applies convolution to capture local spatial features and generates an attention map that selectively emphasizes the most informative regions of the image. This attention mechanism enables the model to focus on discriminative features while suppressing irrelevant background information. I have integrated Vision Eagle Attention into a lightweight ResNet-18 architecture, demonstrating that this combination results in an efficient and powerful model. I have evaluated the performance of the proposed model on three widely used benchmark datasets: FashionMNIST, Intel Image Classification, and OracleMNIST, with a primary focus on image classification. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves classification accuracy. Additionally, this method has the potential to be extended to other vision tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and visual tracking, offering a computationally efficient solution for a wide range of vision-based applications.

MFTIQ builds upon the flow-chaining concepts of MFT, integrating an Independent Quality (IQ) module that separates correspondence quality estimation from optical flow computations. This decoupling significantly enhances the accuracy and flexibility of the tracking process, allowing MFTIQ to maintain reliable trajectory predictions even in scenarios of prolonged occlusions and complex dynamics. Designed to be "plug-and-play", MFTIQ can be employed with any off-the-shelf optical flow method without the need for fine-tuning or architectural modifications.

We formulate a variational inference problem to approximate the posterior density of the state conditioned on the measurement data. We view the unknown data association as a latent variable and apply Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain a filter with update step in the same form as the Kalman filter but with expanded measurement vector of all potential associations. We show that the association probabilities can be computed as permanents of matrices with measurement likelihood entries. We also propose an ambiguity check that associates only a subset of ambiguous measurements and states probabilistically, thus reducing the association time and preventing low-probability measurements from harming the estimation accuracy. Experiments in simulation show that our filter achieves lower tracking errors than the well-established joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), while running at comparable rate. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in multi-object tracking (MOT) on multiple real-world datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack. We achieve better higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) than previous Kalman-filter methods and remain real-time. Associating only bounding boxes without deep features or velocities, our method ranks top-10 on both MOT17 and MOT20 in terms of HOTA.

It is primarily because of the lack of a large-scale, well-annotated night-time benchmark for rigorously evaluating tracking algorithms. To this end, this paper presents NT-VOT211, a new benchmark tailored for evaluating visual object tracking algorithms in the challenging night-time conditions. NT-VOT211 consists of 211 diverse videos, offering 211,000 well-annotated frames with 8 attributes including camera motion, deformation, fast motion, motion blur, tiny target, distractors, occlusion and out-of-view. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest night-time tracking benchmark to-date that is specifically designed to address unique challenges such as adverse visibility, image blur, and distractors inherent to night-time tracking scenarios. Through a comprehensive analysis of results obtained from 42 diverse tracking algorithms on NT-VOT211, we uncover the strengths and limitations of these algorithms, highlighting opportunities for enhancements in visual object tracking, particularly in environments with suboptimal lighting. Besides, a leaderboard for revealing performance rankings, annotation tools, comprehensive meta-information and all the necessary code for reproducibility of results is made publicly available.

Its effectiveness can be improved using depth information, particularly for handling motion-blurred target. However, depth information is often missing in commonly used tracking benchmarks. In this work, we propose a new framework that leverages monocular depth estimation to counter the challenges of tracking targets that are out of view or affected by motion blur in RGB video sequences. Specifically, our work introduces following contributions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a depth attention mechanism and to formulate a simple framework that allows seamlessly integration of depth information with state of the art tracking algorithms, without RGB-D cameras, elevating accuracy and robustness. We provide extensive experiments on six challenging tracking benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that our approach provides consistent gains over several strong baselines and achieves new SOTA performance. We believe that our method will open up new possibilities for more sophisticated VOT solutions in real-world scenarios.

Under this setting, open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) in a single image has been studied in many literature. However, open-vocabulary object tracking (OVT) from a video has been studied less, and one reason is the shortage of benchmarks. In this work, we have built a new large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary multi-object tracking namely OVT-B. OVT-B contains 1,048 categories of objects and 1,973 videos with 637,608 bounding box annotations, which is much larger than the sole open-vocabulary tracking dataset, i.e., OVTAO-val dataset (200+ categories, 900+ videos). The proposed OVT-B can be used as a new benchmark to pave the way for OVT research. We also develop a simple yet effective baseline method for OVT. It integrates the motion features for object tracking, which is an important feature for MOT but is ignored in previous OVT methods. Experimental results have verified the usefulness of the proposed benchmark and the effectiveness of our method. We have released the benchmark to the public at https://github.com/Coo1Sea/OVT-B-Dataset.

Building on this, the MV-GLMB and MV-GLMB-AB filters enhance the MS-GLMB capabilities by employing cameras for 3D multi-sensor multi-object tracking, effectively addressing occlusions. However, both filters depend on overlapping fields of view from the cameras to combine complementary information. In this paper, we introduce an improved approach that integrates an additional sensor, such as LiDAR, into the MS-GLMB framework for 3D multi-object tracking. Specifically, we present a new LiDAR measurement model, along with a multi-camera and LiDAR multi-object measurement model. Our experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in tracking performance compared to existing MS-GLMB-based methods. Importantly, our method eliminates the need for overlapping fields of view, broadening the applicability of the MS-GLMB filter.

Traditional methods like the Kalman Filter (KF) often fail when measurements are intermittent, leading to rapid divergence in state estimations. To address this, we introduce SMART (Sensor Measurement Augmentation and Reacquisition Tracker), a novel approach that leverages high-frequency state estimates from the KF to guide the search for new measurements, maintaining tracking continuity even when direct measurements falter. This is crucial for dynamic environments where traditional methods struggle. Our contributions include: 1) Versatile Measurement Augmentation Using KF Feedback: We implement a versatile measurement augmentation system that serves as a backup when primary object detectors fail intermittently. This system is adaptable to various sensors, demonstrated using depth cameras where KF's 3D predictions are projected into 2D depth image coordinates, integrating nonlinear covariance propagation techniques simplified to first-order approximations. 2) Open-source ROS2 Implementation: We provide an open-source ROS2 implementation of the SMART-TRACK framework, validated in a realistic simulation environment using Gazebo and ROS2, fostering broader adaptation and further research. Our results showcase significant enhancements in tracking stability, with estimation RMSE as low as 0.04 m during measurement disruptions, advancing the robustness of UAV tracking and expanding the potential for reliable autonomous UAV operations in complex scenarios. The implementation is available at https://github.com/mzahana/SMART-TRACK.

This work presents a comprehensive panoptic scene understanding solution designed to handle the complexities of such environments by integrating 2D panoptic segmentation with 3D LiDAR mapping. Our system generates detailed environmental representations in real-time by combining semantic and geometric data, supported by Kalman Filter-based tracking for dynamic object detection. We introduce a fine-tuning method that adapts large pre-trained panoptic segmentation models for construction site applications using a limited number of domain-specific samples. For this use case, we release a first-of-its-kind dataset of 502 hand-labeled sample images with panoptic annotations from construction sites. In addition, we propose a dynamic panoptic mapping technique that enhances scene understanding in unstructured environments. As a case study, we demonstrate the system's application for autonomous navigation, utilizing real-time RRT* for reactive path planning in dynamic scenarios.

Many state-of-the-art event-based algorithms rely on splitting the events into fixed groups, resulting in the omission of crucial temporal information, particularly when dealing with diverse motion scenarios (\eg, high/low speed).In this work, we propose SpikeSlicer, a novel-designed plug-and-play event processing method capable of splitting events stream adaptively.SpikeSlicer utilizes a low-energy spiking neural network (SNN) to trigger event slicing. To guide the SNN to fire spikes at optimal time steps, we propose the Spiking Position-aware Loss (SPA-Loss) to modulate the neuron's state. Additionally, we develop a Feedback-Update training strategy that refines the slicing decisions using feedback from the downstream artificial neural network (ANN). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant performance improvements in event-based object tracking and recognition. Notably, SpikeSlicer provides a brand-new SNN-ANN cooperation paradigm, where the SNN acts as an efficient, low-energy data processor to assist the ANN in improving downstream performance, injecting new perspectives and potential avenues of exploration.

Leveraging the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of large language models, and augmented by the Segment Anything Model, VideoLISA generates temporally consistent segmentation masks in videos based on language instructions. Existing image-based methods, such as LISA, struggle with video tasks due to the additional temporal dimension, which requires temporal dynamic understanding and consistent segmentation across frames. VideoLISA addresses these challenges by integrating a Sparse Dense Sampling strategy into the video-LLM, which balances temporal context and spatial detail within computational constraints. Additionally, we propose a One-Token-Seg-All approach using a specially designed <TRK> token, enabling the model to segment and track objects across multiple frames. Extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks, including our newly introduced ReasonVOS benchmark, demonstrate VideoLISA's superior performance in video object segmentation tasks involving complex reasoning, temporal understanding, and object tracking. While optimized for videos, VideoLISA also shows promising generalization to image segmentation, revealing its potential as a unified foundation model for language-instructed object segmentation.

However, these solutions often sacrifice accuracy for speed to a great extent, and also have the problems of complex training process and structural limitations. Thus, we propose a general model compression framework for efficient transformer object tracking, named CompressTracker, to reduce model size while preserving tracking accuracy. Our approach features a novel stage division strategy that segments the transformer layers of the teacher model into distinct stages to break the limitation of model structure. Additionally, we also design a unique replacement training technique that randomly substitutes specific stages in the student model with those from the teacher model, as opposed to training the student model in isolation. Replacement training enhances the student model's ability to replicate the teacher model's behavior and simplifies the training process. To further forcing student model to emulate teacher model, we incorporate prediction guidance and stage-wise feature mimicking to provide additional supervision during the teacher model's compression process. CompressTracker is structurally agnostic, making it compatible with any transformer architecture. We conduct a series of experiment to verify the effectiveness and generalizability of our CompressTracker. Our CompressTracker-SUTrack, compressed from SUTrack, retains about 99 performance on LaSOT (72.2 AUC) while achieves 2.42x speed up.

However, these datasets have primarily focused on open-air scenarios and have largely overlooked underwater animal tracking-especially the complex challenges posed by camouflaged marine animals. To bridge this gap, we take a step forward by proposing the first large-scale multi-modal underwater camouflaged object tracking dataset, namely UW-COT220. Based on the proposed dataset, this work first comprehensively evaluates current advanced visual object tracking methods, including SAM- and SAM2-based trackers, in challenging underwater environments, \eg, coral reefs. Our findings highlight the improvements of SAM2 over SAM, demonstrating its enhanced ability to handle the complexities of underwater camouflaged objects. Furthermore, we propose a novel vision-language tracking framework called VL-SAM2, based on the video foundation model SAM2. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across underwater and open-air object tracking datasets.

However, in low-light conditions, the presence of irregular real noise from the environments severely degrades the performance of these SOTA methods. Moreover, existing SOTA denoising techniques often fail to meet the real-time processing requirements when deployed as plug-and-play denoisers for UAV tracking. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel conditional generative denoiser (CGDenoiser), which breaks free from the limitations of traditional deterministic paradigms and generates the noise conditioning on the input, subsequently removing it. To better align the input dimensions and accelerate inference, a novel nested residual Transformer conditionalizer is developed. Furthermore, an innovative multi-kernel conditional refiner is designed to pertinently refine the denoised output. Extensive experiments show that CGDenoiser promotes the tracking precision of the SOTA tracker by 18.18\% on DarkTrack2021 whereas working 5.8 times faster than the second well-performed denoiser. Real-world tests with complex challenges also prove the effectiveness and practicality of CGDenoiser.

However, learning robust object representations for UAV tracking is especially challenging in complex dynamic environments, when confronted with aspect ratio change and occlusion. These challenges severely alter the original information of the object. To handle the above issues, this work proposes a novel progressive representation learning framework for UAV tracking, i.e., PRL-Track. Specifically, PRL-Track is divided into coarse representation learning and fine representation learning. For coarse representation learning, two innovative regulators, which rely on appearance and semantic information, are designed to mitigate appearance interference and capture semantic information. Furthermore, for fine representation learning, a new hierarchical modeling generator is developed to intertwine coarse object representations. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PRL-Track delivers exceptional performance on three authoritative UAV tracking benchmarks. Real-world tests indicate that the proposed PRL-Track realizes superior tracking performance with 42.6 frames per second on the typical UAV platform equipped with an edge smart camera.

However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) enhancers for nighttime UAV tracking always neglect the uneven light distribution in low-light images, inevitably leading to excessive enhancement in scenarios with complex illumination. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel enhancer, i.e., LDEnhancer, enhancing nighttime UAV tracking with light distribution suppression. Specifically, a novel image content refinement module is developed to decompose the light distribution information and image content information in the feature space, allowing for the targeted enhancement of the image content information. Then this work designs a new light distribution generation module to capture light distribution effectively. The features with light distribution information and image content information are fed into the different parameter estimation modules, respectively, for the parameter map prediction. Finally, leveraging two parameter maps, an innovative interweave iteration adjustment is proposed for the collaborative pixel-wise adjustment of low-light images. Additionally, a challenging nighttime UAV tracking dataset with uneven light distribution, namely NAT2024-2, is constructed to provide a comprehensive evaluation, which contains 40 challenging sequences with over 74K frames in total. Experimental results on the authoritative UAV benchmarks and the proposed NAT2024-2 demonstrate that LDEnhancer outperforms other SOTA low-light enhancers for nighttime UAV tracking. Furthermore, real-world tests on a typical UAV platform with an NVIDIA Orin NX confirm the practicality and efficiency of LDEnhancer.

Most of the wheelchair users need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote control mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode. In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs, such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks for their needs.

Currently, the best-performing methods are mainly based on pure appearance matching. Due to the complexity of motion patterns in the large-vocabulary scenarios and unstable classification of the novel objects, the motion and semantics cues are either ignored or applied based on heuristics in the final matching steps by existing methods. In this paper, we present a unified framework SLAck that jointly considers semantics, location, and appearance priors in the early steps of association and learns how to integrate all valuable information through a lightweight spatial and temporal object graph. Our method eliminates complex post-processing heuristics for fusing different cues and boosts the association performance significantly for large-scale open-vocabulary tracking.

Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field.

Classical closed-vocabulary MOT (CV-MOT) methods aim to track objects of predefined categories. Recently, some open-vocabulary MOT (OV-MOT) methods have successfully addressed the problem of tracking unknown categories. However, we found that the CV-MOT and OV-MOT methods each struggle to excel in the tasks of the other. In this paper, we present a unified framework, Associate Everything Detected (AED), that simultaneously tackles CV-MOT and OV-MOT by integrating with any off-the-shelf detector and supports unknown categories. Different from existing tracking-by-detection MOT methods, AED gets rid of prior knowledge (e.g. motion cues) and relies solely on highly robust feature learning to handle complex trajectories in OV-MOT tasks while keeping excellent performance in CV-MOT tasks. Specifically, we model the association task as a similarity decoding problem and propose a sim-decoder with an association-centric learning mechanism. The sim-decoder calculates similarities in three aspects: spatial, temporal, and cross-clip. Subsequently, association-centric learning leverages these threefold similarities to ensure that the extracted features are appropriate for continuous tracking and robust enough to generalize to unknown categories. Compared with existing powerful OV-MOT and CV-MOT methods, AED achieves superior performance on TAO, SportsMOT, and DanceTrack without any prior knowledge. Our code is available at https://github.com/balabooooo/AED.

While end-to-end object detection and tracking have been the main focus of recent research, they have yet to outperform traditional methods in benchmarks like MOT17 and MOT20. Thus, from an application standpoint, methods with separate detection and embedding remain the best option for accuracy, modularity, and ease of implementation, though they are impractical for edge devices due to the overhead involved. In this paper, we investigate a selective approach to minimize the overhead of feature extraction while preserving accuracy, modularity, and ease of implementation. This approach can be integrated into various SOTA methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to StrongSORT and Deep OC-SORT. Experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets show that our mechanism retains the advantages of feature extraction during occlusions while significantly reducing runtime. Additionally, it improves accuracy by preventing confusion in the feature-matching stage, particularly in cases of deformation and appearance similarity, which are common in DanceTrack. https://github.com/emirhanbayar/Fast-StrongSORT, https://github.com/emirhanbayar/Fast-Deep-OC-SORT

It enhances ReID-based trackers by eliminating inference, pre-processing, post-processing, and ReID model training costs. LITE uses real-time appearance features without compromising speed. By integrating appearance feature extraction directly into the tracking pipeline using standard CNN-based detectors such as YOLOv8m, LITE demonstrates significant performance improvements. The simplest implementation of LITE on top of classic DeepSORT achieves a HOTA score of 43.03% at 28.3 FPS on the MOT17 benchmark, making it twice as fast as DeepSORT on MOT17 and four times faster on the more crowded MOT20 dataset, while maintaining similar accuracy. Additionally, a new evaluation framework for tracking-by-detection approaches reveals that conventional trackers like DeepSORT remain competitive with modern state-of-the-art trackers when evaluated under fair conditions.

However, current motion models struggle to be both efficient and effective across different application scenarios. To this end, we propose TrackSSM inspired by the recently popular state space models (SSM), a unified encoder-decoder motion framework that uses data-dependent state space model to perform temporal motion of trajectories. Specifically, we propose Flow-SSM, a module that utilizes the position and motion information from historical trajectories to guide the temporal state transition of object bounding boxes. Based on Flow-SSM, we design a flow decoder. It is composed of a cascaded motion decoding module employing Flow-SSM, which can use the encoded flow information to complete the temporal position prediction of trajectories. Additionally, we propose a Step-by-Step Linear (S$^2$L) training strategy. By performing linear interpolation between the positions of the object in the previous frame and the current frame, we construct the pseudo labels of step-by-step linear training, ensuring that the trajectory flow information can better guide the object bounding box in completing temporal transitions. TrackSSM utilizes a simple Mamba-Block to build a motion encoder for historical trajectories, forming a temporal motion model with an encoder-decoder structure in conjunction with the flow decoder. TrackSSM is applicable to various tracking scenarios and achieves excellent tracking performance across multiple benchmarks, further extending the potential of SSM-like temporal motion models in multi-object tracking tasks.

Existed MOT methods excel at accurately tracking multiple objects in real-time across various scenarios. However, these methods still face challenges such as poor noise resistance and frequent ID switches. In this research, we propose a novel ConsistencyTrack, joint detection and tracking(JDT) framework that formulates detection and association as a denoising diffusion process on perturbed bounding boxes. This progressive denoising strategy significantly improves the model's noise resistance. During the training phase, paired object boxes within two adjacent frames are diffused from ground-truth boxes to a random distribution, and then the model learns to detect and track by reversing this process. In inference, the model refines randomly generated boxes into detection and tracking results through minimal denoising steps. ConsistencyTrack also introduces an innovative target association strategy to address target occlusion. Experiments on the MOT17 and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate that ConsistencyTrack outperforms other compared methods, especially better than DiffusionTrack in inference speed and other performance metrics.

While significant progress has been made in tracking general objects, research on more challenging scenarios, such as tracking camouflaged objects, remains limited. Camouflaged objects, which blend seamlessly with their surroundings or other objects, present unique challenges for detection and tracking in complex environments. This challenge is particularly critical in applications such as military, security, agriculture, and marine monitoring, where precise tracking of camouflaged objects is essential. To address this gap, we introduce the Camouflaged Object Tracking Dataset (COTD), a specialized benchmark designed specifically for evaluating camouflaged object tracking methods. The COTD dataset comprises 200 sequences and approximately 80,000 frames, each annotated with detailed bounding boxes. Our evaluation of 20 existing tracking algorithms reveals significant deficiencies in their performance with camouflaged objects. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework, HiPTrack-MLS, which demonstrates promising results in improving tracking performance for camouflaged objects. COTD and code are avialable at https://github.com/openat25/HIPTrack-MLS.

However, this aspect of the problem is mostly overlooked or mitigated by employing two-stage association and utilizing low confidence detections in the second stage. Recently proposed BoostTrack attempts to avoid the drawbacks of multiple stage association approach and use low-confidence detections by applying detection confidence boosting. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the confidence boost used in BoostTrack and propose a method to improve its performance. To construct a richer similarity measure and enable a better selection of true positive detections, we propose to use a combination of shape, Mahalanobis distance and novel soft BIoU similarity. We propose a soft detection confidence boost technique which calculates new confidence scores based on the similarity measure and the previous confidence scores, and we introduce varying similarity threshold to account for lower similarity measure between detections and tracklets which are not regularly updated. The proposed additions are mutually independent and can be used in any MOT algorithm.
  Combined with the BoostTrack+ baseline, our method achieves near state of the art results on the MOT17 dataset and new state of the art HOTA and IDF1 scores on the MOT20 dataset.

This is quantitatively achieved by means of evaluation metrics. Unfortunately, current metrics favor local correctness and weakly reward global coherence, impeding high-level biological analysis. To also foster global coherence, we propose the CHOTA metric (Cell-specific Higher Order Tracking Accuracy) which unifies the evaluation of all relevant aspects of cell tracking: cell detections and local associations, global coherence, and lineage tracking. We achieve this by introducing a new definition of the term 'trajectory' that includes the entire cell lineage and by including this into the well-established HOTA metric from general multiple object tracking. Furthermore, we provide a detailed survey of contemporary cell tracking metrics to compare our novel CHOTA metric and to show its advantages. All metrics are extensively evaluated on state-of-the-art real-data cell tracking results and synthetic results that simulate specific tracking errors. We show that CHOTA is sensitive to all tracking errors and gives a good indication of the biologically relevant capability of a method to reconstruct the full lineage of cells. It introduces a robust and comprehensive alternative to the currently used metrics in cell tracking. Python code is available at https://github.com/CellTrackingChallenge/py-ctcmetrics .

These datasets have supported the development of sophisticated algorithms, enhancing the accuracy and stability of visual object tracking. However, most research has primarily focused on favorable illumination circumstances, neglecting the challenges of tracking in low-ligh environments. In low-light scenes, lighting may change dramatically, targets may lack distinct texture features, and in some scenarios, targets may not be directly observable. These factors can lead to a severe decline in tracking performance. To address this issue, we introduce LLOT, a benchmark specifically designed for Low-Light Object Tracking. LLOT comprises 269 challenging sequences with a total of over 132K frames, each carefully annotated with bounding boxes. This specially designed dataset aims to promote innovation and advancement in object tracking techniques for low-light conditions, addressing challenges not adequately covered by existing benchmarks. To assess the performance of existing methods on LLOT, we conducted extensive tests on 39 state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. The results highlight a considerable gap in low-light tracking performance. In response, we propose H-DCPT, a novel tracker that incorporates historical and darkness clue prompts to set a stronger baseline. H-DCPT outperformed all 39 evaluated methods in our experiments, demonstrating significant improvements. We hope that our benchmark and H-DCPT will stimulate the development of novel and accurate methods for tracking objects in low-light conditions.

Current event-based tracking algorithms are gradually hitting their performance bottlenecks, due to the utilization of vision Transformer and the static template for target object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel Mamba-based visual tracking framework that adopts the state space model with linear complexity as a backbone network. The search regions and target template are fed into the vision Mamba network for simultaneous feature extraction and interaction. The output tokens of search regions will be fed into the tracking head for target localization. More importantly, we consider introducing a dynamic template update strategy into the tracking framework using the Memory Mamba network. By considering the diversity of samples in the target template library and making appropriate adjustments to the template memory module, a more effective dynamic template can be integrated. The effective combination of dynamic and static templates allows our Mamba-based tracking algorithm to achieve a good balance between accuracy and computational cost on multiple large-scale datasets, including EventVOT, VisEvent, and FE240hz.

Conversely, the motion-centric paradigm avoids appearance matching, thus overcoming these issues. However, its complex multi-stage pipeline and the limited temporal modeling capability of a single-stream architecture constrain its potential. In this paper, we introduce SiamMo, a novel and simple Siamese motion-centric tracking approach. Unlike the traditional single-stream architecture, we employ Siamese feature extraction for motion-centric tracking. This decouples feature extraction from temporal fusion, significantly enhancing tracking performance. Additionally, we design a Spatio-Temporal Feature Aggregation module to integrate Siamese features at multiple scales, capturing motion information effectively. We also introduce a Box-aware Feature Encoding module to encode object size priors into motion estimation. SiamMo is a purely motion-centric tracker that eliminates the need for additional processes like segmentation and box refinement. Without whistles and bells, SiamMo not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in challenging scenarios. SiamMo sets a new record on the KITTI tracking benchmark with 90.1\% precision while maintaining a high inference speed of 108 FPS. The code will be released at https://github.com/HDU-VRLab/SiamMo.

In this work, we contribute a large-scale Visible-Thermal video benchmark for MOT, called VT-MOT. VT-MOT has the following main advantages. 1) The data is large scale and high diversity. VT-MOT includes 582 video sequence pairs, 401k frame pairs from surveillance, drone, and handheld platforms. 2) The cross-modal alignment is highly accurate. We invite several professionals to perform both spatial and temporal alignment frame by frame. 3) The annotation is dense and high-quality. VT-MOT has 3.99 million annotation boxes annotated and double-checked by professionals, including heavy occlusion and object re-acquisition (object disappear and reappear) challenges. To provide a strong baseline, we design a simple yet effective tracking framework, which effectively fuses temporal information and complementary information of two modalities in a progressive manner, for robust visible-thermal MOT. A comprehensive experiment are conducted on VT-MOT and the results prove the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Recently, naturalistic studies have gained traction as a way to capture the complex behavioural and infrastructural factors that contribute to crashes. These approaches typically involve the collection and analysis of video data. A video promising format is panoramic video, which can record 360-degree views around a rider. However, its use is limited by severe distortions, large numbers of small objects and boundary continuity. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel three-step framework: (1) enhancing object detection accuracy on panoramic imagery by segmenting and projecting the original 360-degree images into four perspective sub-images, thus reducing distortion; (2) modifying multi-object tracking models to incorporate boundary continuity and object category information for improved tracking consistency; and (3) validating the proposed approach through a real-world application focused on detecting overtaking manoeuvres by vehicles around cyclists. The methodology is evaluated using panoramic videos recorded by cyclists on London's roadways under diverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate notable improvements over baseline methods, achieving higher average precision across varying image resolutions. Moreover, the enhanced tracking approach yields a 3.0% increase in multi-object tracking accuracy and a 4.6% improvement in identification F-score. The overtaking detection task achieves a high F-score of 0.81, illustrating the practical effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world cycling safety scenarios.

However, solving the competition between the detector and the feature extractor has always been a challenge. Meanwhile, the issue of directly embedding the ReID task into MOT has remained unresolved. The lack of high discriminability in appearance features results in their limited utility. In this paper, a new learning approach using cross-correlation to capture temporal information of objects is proposed. The feature extraction network is no longer trained solely on appearance features from each frame but learns richer motion features by utilizing feature heatmaps from consecutive frames, which addresses the challenge of inter-class feature similarity. Furthermore, our learning approach is applied to a more lightweight feature extraction network, and treat the feature matching scores as strong cues rather than auxiliary cues, with an appropriate weight calculation to reflect the compatibility between our obtained features and the MOT task. Our tracker, named TCBTrack, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public benchmarks, i.e., MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets. Specifically, on the DanceTrack test set, we achieve 56.8 HOTA, 58.1 IDF1 and 92.5 MOTA, making it the best online tracker capable of achieving real-time performance. Comparative evaluations with other trackers prove that our tracker achieves the best balance between speed, robustness and accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/yfzhang1214/TCBTrack.

The prevailing approach, tracking-by-detection (TbD), first detects objects and then links detections, resulting in a simple yet effective method. However, contemporary detectors may occasionally miss some objects in certain frames, causing trackers to cease tracking prematurely. To tackle this issue, we propose BUSCA, meaning `to search', a versatile framework compatible with any online TbD system, enhancing its ability to persistently track those objects missed by the detector, primarily due to occlusions. Remarkably, this is accomplished without modifying past tracking results or accessing future frames, i.e., in a fully online manner. BUSCA generates proposals based on neighboring tracks, motion, and learned tokens. Utilizing a decision Transformer that integrates multimodal visual and spatiotemporal information, it addresses the object-proposal association as a multi-choice question-answering task. BUSCA is trained independently of the underlying tracker, solely on synthetic data, without requiring fine-tuning.

Our solution is based on the labeled random finite set (LRFS) filtering approach, which in principle, addresses disappearance, appearance, reappearance, and occlusion via a single Bayesian recursion. However, in practice, existing numerical approximations cause reappearing objects to be initialized as new tracks, especially after long periods of being undetected. In occlusion handling, the filter's efficacy is dictated by trade-offs between the sophistication of the occlusion model and computational demand. Our contribution is a novel modeling method that exploits object features to address reappearing objects whilst maintaining a linear complexity in the number of detections. Moreover, to improve the filter's occlusion handling, we propose a fuzzy detection model that takes into consideration the overlapping areas between tracks and their sizes. We also develop a fast version of the filter to further reduce the computational time. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/linh-gist/mv-glmb-ab.

However, the high-speed movement of UAVs and targets introduces unique challenges, including real-time processing demands and severe motion blur, which degrade the performance of existing generic trackers. While single-stream vision transformer (ViT) architectures have shown promise in visual tracking, their computational inefficiency and lack of UAV-specific optimizations limit their practicality in this domain. In this paper, we boost the efficiency of this framework by tailoring it into an adaptive computation framework that dynamically exits Transformer blocks for real-time UAV tracking. The motivation behind this is that tracking tasks with fewer challenges can be adequately addressed using low-level feature representations. Simpler tasks can often be handled with less demanding, lower-level features. This approach allows the model use computational resources more efficiently by focusing on complex tasks and conserving resources for easier ones. Another significant enhancement introduced in this paper is the improved effectiveness of ViTs in handling motion blur, a common issue in UAV tracking caused by the fast movements of either the UAV, the tracked objects, or both. This is achieved by acquiring motion blur robust representations through enforcing invariance in the feature representation of the target with respect to simulated motion blur. We refer to our proposed approach as BDTrack. Extensive experiments conducted on four tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach, demonstrating its potential as a practical and effective approach for real-time UAV tracking.

While motion paradigm exploits motion cues instead of appearance matching for tracking, it incurs complex multi-stage processing and segmentation module. In this paper, we first provide in-depth explorations on motion paradigm, which proves that (\textbf{i}) it is feasible to directly infer target relative motion from point clouds across consecutive frames; (\textbf{ii}) fine-grained information comparison between consecutive point clouds facilitates target motion modeling. We thereby propose to perform part-to-part motion modeling for consecutive point clouds and introduce a novel tracking framework, termed \textbf{P2P}. The novel framework fuses each corresponding part information between consecutive point clouds, effectively exploring detailed information changes and thus modeling accurate target-related motion cues. Following this framework, we present P2P-point and P2P-voxel models, incorporating implicit and explicit part-to-part motion modeling by point- and voxel-based representation, respectively. Without bells and whistles, P2P-voxel sets a new state-of-the-art performance ($\sim$\textbf{89\%}, \textbf{72\%} and \textbf{63\%} precision on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, respectively). Moreover, under the same point-based representation, P2P-point outperforms the previous motion tracker M$^2$Track by \textbf{3.3\%} and \textbf{6.7\%} on the KITTI and NuScenes, while running at a considerably high speed of \textbf{107 Fps} on a single RTX3090 GPU.

These datasets have enabled the development of numerous algorithms that can track objects with high accuracy and robustness.However, the majority of current research has been directed towards tracking generic objects, with less emphasis on more specialized and challenging scenarios. One such challenging scenario involves tracking reflected objects. Reflections can significantly distort the appearance of objects, creating ambiguous visual cues that complicate the tracking process. This issue is particularly pertinent in applications such as autonomous driving, security, smart homes, and industrial production, where accurately tracking objects reflected in surfaces like mirrors or glass is crucial. To address this gap, we introduce TRO, a benchmark specifically for Tracking Reflected Objects. TRO includes 200 sequences with around 70,000 frames, each carefully annotated with bounding boxes. This dataset aims to encourage the development of new, accurate methods for tracking reflected objects, which present unique challenges not sufficiently covered by existing benchmarks. We evaluated 20 state-of-the-art trackers and found that they struggle with the complexities of reflections. To provide a stronger baseline, we propose a new tracker, HiP-HaTrack, which uses hierarchical features to improve performance, significantly outperforming existing algorithms. We believe our benchmark, evaluation, and HiP-HaTrack will inspire further research and applications in tracking reflected objects. The TRO and code are available at https://github.com/OpenCodeGithub/HIP-HaTrack.

We propose the first certifiably optimal category-level approach for simultaneous shape estimation and pose tracking of an object of known category (e.g. a car). Our approach uses 3D semantic keypoint measurements extracted from an RGB-D image sequence, and phrases the estimation as a fixed-lag smoothing problem. Temporal constraints enforce the object's rigidity (fixed shape) and smooth motion according to a constant-twist motion model. The solutions to this problem are the estimates of the object's state (poses, velocities) and shape (paramaterized according to the active shape model) over the smoothing horizon. Our key contribution is to show that despite the non-convexity of the fixed-lag smoothing problem, we can solve it to certifiable optimality using a small-size semidefinite relaxation. We also present a fast outlier rejection scheme that filters out incorrect keypoint detections with shape and time compatibility tests, and wrap our certifiable solver in a graduated non-convexity scheme. We evaluate the proposed approach on synthetic and real data, showcasing its performance in a table-top manipulation scenario and a drone-based vehicle tracking application.

Current dominant solutions, e.g. ByteTrack and StrongSORT++, follow the hybrid pipeline, which first accomplish most of the associations in an online manner, and then refine the results using offline tricks such as interpolation and global link. While this paradigm offers flexibility in application, the disjoint design between the two stages results in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical IoU Tracking framework, dubbed HIT, which achieves unified hierarchical tracking by utilizing tracklet intervals as priors. To ensure the conciseness, only IoU is utilized for association, while discarding the heavy appearance models, tricky auxiliary cues, and learning-based association modules. We further identify three inconsistency issues regarding target size, camera movement and hierarchical cues, and design corresponding solutions to guarantee the reliability of associations. Though its simplicity, our method achieves promising performance on four datasets, i.e., MOT17, KITTI, DanceTrack and VisDrone, providing a strong baseline for future tracking method design. Moreover, we experiment on seven trackers and prove that HIT can be seamlessly integrated with other solutions, whether they are motion-based, appearance-based or learning-based.

It aims to track objects based on human language commands, replacing the traditional use of templates or pre-set information from training sets in conventional tracking tasks. Despite various efforts, a key challenge lies in the lack of a clear understanding of why language is used for tracking, which hinders further development in this field. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing Language-Guided MOT, a unified task framework, along with a corresponding large-scale benchmark, termed LaMOT, which encompasses diverse scenarios and language descriptions. Specially, LaMOT comprises 1,660 sequences from 4 different datasets and aims to unify various Vision-Language MOT tasks while providing a standardized evaluation platform. To ensure high-quality annotations, we manually assign appropriate descriptive texts to each target in every video and conduct careful inspection and correction. To the best of our knowledge, LaMOT is the first benchmark dedicated to Language-Guided MOT. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective tracker, termed LaMOTer. By establishing a unified task framework, providing challenging benchmarks, and offering insights for future algorithm design and evaluation, we expect to contribute to the advancement of research in Vision-Language MOT. We will release the data at https://github.com/Nathan-Li123/LaMOT.

However, the slow speed of current trackers limits their applicability on devices with constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce ABTrack, an adaptive computation framework that adaptively bypassing transformer blocks for efficient visual tracking. The rationale behind ABTrack is rooted in the observation that semantic features or relations do not uniformly impact the tracking task across all abstraction levels. Instead, this impact varies based on the characteristics of the target and the scene it occupies. Consequently, disregarding insignificant semantic features or relations at certain abstraction levels may not significantly affect the tracking accuracy. We propose a Bypass Decision Module (BDM) to determine if a transformer block should be bypassed, which adaptively simplifies the architecture of ViTs and thus speeds up the inference process. To counteract the time cost incurred by the BDMs and further enhance the efficiency of ViTs, we introduce a novel ViT pruning method to reduce the dimension of the latent representation of tokens in each transformer block. Extensive experiments on multiple tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Existing RMOT benchmarks are usually formulated through manual annotations, integrated with static regulations. This approach results in a dearth of notable diversity and a constrained scope of implementation. In this work, our key idea is to bootstrap the task of referring multi-object tracking by introducing discriminative language words as much as possible. In specific, we first develop Refer-KITTI into a large-scale dataset, named Refer-KITTI-V2. It starts with 2,719 manual annotations, addressing the issue of class imbalance and introducing more keywords to make it closer to real-world scenarios compared to Refer-KITTI. They are further expanded to a total of 9,758 annotations by prompting large language models, which create 617 different words, surpassing previous RMOT benchmarks. In addition, the end-to-end framework in RMOT is also bootstrapped by a simple yet elegant temporal advancement strategy, which achieves better performance than previous approaches.

While such a feature learning scheme achieves promising performance, learning discriminative features solely based on visual information is challenging especially in case of environmental interference such as occlusion, blur and domain variance. In this work, we argue that multi-modal language-driven features provide complementary information to classical visual features, thereby aiding in improving the robustness to such environmental interference. To this end, we propose a new multi-object tracking framework, named LG-MOT, that explicitly leverages language information at different levels of granularity (scene-and instance-level) and combines it with standard visual features to obtain discriminative representations. To develop LG-MOT, we annotate existing MOT datasets with scene-and instance-level language descriptions. We then encode both instance-and scene-level language information into high-dimensional embeddings, which are utilized to guide the visual features during training. At inference, our LG-MOT uses the standard visual features without relying on annotated language descriptions. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, MOT17, DanceTrack and SportsMOT, reveal the merits of the proposed contributions leading to state-of-the-art performance. On the DanceTrack test set, our LG-MOT achieves an absolute gain of 2.2\% in terms of target object association (IDF1 score), compared to the baseline using only visual features. Further, our LG-MOT exhibits strong cross-domain generalizability. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/WesLee88524/LG-MOT.

Current methods predominantly rely on labeled domain-specific video datasets, which limits the cross-domain generalization of learned similarity embeddings. We propose MASA, a novel method for robust instance association learning, capable of matching any objects within videos across diverse domains without tracking labels. Leveraging the rich object segmentation from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), MASA learns instance-level correspondence through exhaustive data transformations. We treat the SAM outputs as dense object region proposals and learn to match those regions from a vast image collection. We further design a universal MASA adapter which can work in tandem with foundational segmentation or detection models and enable them to track any detected objects. Those combinations present strong zero-shot tracking ability in complex domains. Extensive tests on multiple challenging MOT and MOTS benchmarks indicate that the proposed method, using only unlabeled static images, achieves even better performance than state-of-the-art methods trained with fully annotated in-domain video sequences, in zero-shot association.

This paper focuses on understanding how transformer trackers behave under adversarial attacks and how different attacks perform on tracking datasets as their parameters change. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of existing adversarial attacks on object trackers with transformer and non-transformer backbones. We experimented on 7 different trackers, including 3 that are transformer-based, and 4 which leverage other architectures. These trackers are tested against 4 recent attack methods to assess their performance and robustness on VOT2022ST, UAV123 and GOT10k datasets. Our empirical study focuses on evaluating adversarial robustness of object trackers based on bounding box versus binary mask predictions, and attack methods at different levels of perturbations. Interestingly, our study found that altering the perturbation level may not significantly affect the overall object tracking results after the attack. Similarly, the sparsity and imperceptibility of the attack perturbations may remain stable against perturbation level shifts. By applying a specific attack on all transformer trackers, we show that new transformer trackers having a stronger cross-attention modeling achieve a greater adversarial robustness on tracking datasets, such as VOT2022ST and GOT10k. Our results also indicate the necessity for new attack methods to effectively tackle the latest types of transformer trackers.

Effective trackers should demonstrate a high degree of generalizability across diverse scenarios. However, existing trackers struggle to accommodate all aspects or necessitate hypothesis and experimentation to customize the association information motion and or appearance for a given scenario, leading to narrowly tailored solutions with limited generalizability. In this paper, we investigate the factors that influence trackers generalization to different scenarios and concretize them into a set of tracking scenario attributes to guide the design of more generalizable trackers. Furthermore, we propose a point-wise to instance-wise relation framework for MOT, i.e., GeneralTrack, which can generalize across diverse scenarios while eliminating the need to balance motion and appearance. Thanks to its superior generalizability, our proposed GeneralTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and demonstrates the potential for domain generalization. https://github.com/qinzheng2000/GeneralTrack.git

However, current UOT datasets suffer from limitations in scale, diversity of target categories and scenarios covered, hindering the training and evaluation of modern tracking algorithms. To bridge this gap, we take the first step and introduce WebUOT-1M, \ie, the largest public UOT benchmark to date, sourced from complex and realistic underwater environments. It comprises 1.1 million frames across 1,500 video clips filtered from 408 target categories, largely surpassing previous UOT datasets, \eg, UVOT400. Through meticulous manual annotation and verification, we provide high-quality bounding boxes for underwater targets. Additionally, WebUOT-1M includes language prompts for video sequences, expanding its application areas, \eg, underwater vision-language tracking. Most existing trackers are tailored for open-air environments, leading to performance degradation when applied to UOT due to domain gaps. Retraining and fine-tuning these trackers are challenging due to sample imbalances and limited real-world underwater datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel omni-knowledge distillation framework based on WebUOT-1M, incorporating various strategies to guide the learning of the student Transformer. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first to effectively transfer open-air domain knowledge to the UOT model through knowledge distillation, as demonstrated by results on both existing UOT datasets and the newly proposed WebUOT-1M. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluate WebUOT-1M using 30 deep trackers, showcasing its value as a benchmark for UOT research by presenting new challenges and opportunities for future studies. The complete dataset, codes and tracking results, will be made publicly available.

Moreover, this approach does not require detector retraining when cameras are reconfigured but only the camera matrices of reconfigured cameras need to be updated. Our approach is based on a Bayesian multi-object formulation that integrates track initiation/termination, re-identification, occlusion handling, and data association into a single Bayes filtering recursion. However, the exact filter that utilizes all these functionalities is numerically intractable due to the exponentially growing number of terms in the (multi-object) filtering density, while existing approximations trade-off some of these functionalities for speed. To this end, we develop a more efficient approximation suitable for online MOT by incorporating object features and kinematics into the measurement model, which improves data association and subsequently reduces the number of terms. Specifically, we exploit the 2D detections and extracted features from multiple cameras to provide a better approximation of the multi-object filtering density to realize the track initiation/termination and re-identification functionalities. Further, incorporating a tractable geometric occlusion model based on 2D projections of 3D objects on the camera planes realizes the occlusion handling functionality of the filter. Evaluation of the proposed solution on challenging datasets demonstrates significant improvements and robustness when camera configurations change on-the-fly, compared to existing multi-view MOT solutions.

While a generalist model capable of leveraging all modalities would be ideal, development is hindered by data sparsity, typically in practice, only one modality is available at a time. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure and achieve that knowledge gained from multimodal sensing -- such as identifying relevant features and regions -- is effectively shared, even when certain modalities are unavailable at inference. We venture with a simple assumption: similar samples across different modalities have more knowledge to share than otherwise. To implement this, we employ a ``weak" classifier tasked with distinguishing between modalities. More specifically, if the classifier ``fails" to accurately identify the modality of the given sample, this signals an opportunity for cross-modal knowledge sharing. Intuitively, knowledge transfer is facilitated whenever a sample from one modality is sufficiently close and aligned with another. Technically, we achieve this by routing samples from one modality to the expert of the others, within a mixture-of-experts framework designed for multimodal video object tracking. During the inference, the expert of the respective modality is chosen, which we show to benefit from the multimodal knowledge available during training, thanks to the proposed method. Through the exhaustive experiments that use only paired RGB-E, RGB-D, and RGB-T during training, we showcase the benefit of the proposed method for RGB-X tracker during inference, with an average +3\% precision improvement over the current SOTA.

Unlike multiple object tracking (MOT) for natural images, cell tracking typically involves hundreds of similar-looking objects that can divide in each frame, making it a particularly challenging problem. Current state-of-the-art approaches follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm, i.e. first all cells are detected per frame and successively linked in a second step to form biologically consistent cell tracks. Linking is commonly solved via discrete optimization methods, which require manual tuning of hyperparameters for each dataset and are therefore cumbersome to use in practice. Here we propose Trackastra, a general purpose cell tracking approach that uses a simple transformer architecture to directly learn pairwise associations of cells within a temporal window from annotated data. Importantly, unlike existing transformer-based MOT pipelines, our learning architecture also accounts for dividing objects such as cells and allows for accurate tracking even with simple greedy linking, thus making strides towards removing the requirement for a complex linking step. The proposed architecture operates on the full spatio-temporal context of detections within a time window by avoiding the computational burden of processing dense images. We show that our tracking approach performs on par with or better than highly tuned state-of-the-art cell tracking algorithms for various biological datasets, such as bacteria, cell cultures and fluorescent particles. We provide code at https://github.com/weigertlab/trackastra.

It is of great significance for many applications such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance. In recent years, MMOT has received more and more attention. However, existing MMOT algorithms mainly focus on two modalities (\eg RGB+depth, RGB+thermal infrared, and RGB+language). To leverage more modalities, some recent efforts have been made to learn a unified visual object tracking model for any modality. Additionally, some large-scale multi-modal tracking benchmarks have been established by simultaneously providing more than two modalities, such as vision-language-audio (\eg WebUAV-3M) and vision-depth-language (\eg UniMod1K). To track the latest progress in MMOT, we conduct a comprehensive investigation in this report. Specifically, we first divide existing MMOT tasks into five main categories, \ie RGBL tracking, RGBE tracking, RGBD tracking, RGBT tracking, and miscellaneous (RGB+X), where X can be any modality, such as language, depth, and event. Then, we analyze and summarize each MMOT task, focusing on widely used datasets and mainstream tracking algorithms based on their technical paradigms (\eg self-supervised learning, prompt learning, knowledge distillation, generative models, and state space models). Finally, we maintain a continuously updated paper list for MMOT at https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking.

However, long-term tracking remains challenging. While graph-based approaches address this by modeling trajectories as global graphs, these methods are unsuitable for real-time applications due to their non-online nature. In this paper, we review the concept of trajectory graphs and propose a novel perspective by representing them as directed acyclic graphs. This representation can be described using frame-ordered object sequences and binary adjacency matrices. We observe that this structure naturally aligns with Transformer attention mechanisms, enabling us to model the association problem using a classic Transformer architecture. Based on this insight, we introduce a concise Pure Transformer (PuTR) to validate the effectiveness of Transformer in unifying short- and long-term tracking for separated online MOT. Extensive experiments on four diverse datasets (SportsMOT, DanceTrack, MOT17, and MOT20) demonstrate that PuTR effectively establishes a solid baseline compared to existing foundational online methods while exhibiting superior domain adaptation capabilities. Furthermore, the separated nature enables efficient training and inference, making it suitable for practical applications. Implementation code and trained models are available at https://github.com/chongweiliu/PuTR .

When no global position information is available (e.g., indoor or GPS-denied environments), agents must align their coordinate frames before shared spatial information can be properly expressed and interpreted. Coordinate frame alignment is particularly difficult when robots have no initial alignment and are affected by odometry drift. To this end, we develop a novel multiple hypothesis algorithm, called TCAFF, for aligning the coordinate frames of neighboring robots. TCAFF considers potential alignments from associating sparse open-set object maps and leverages temporal consistency to determine an initial alignment and correct for drift, all without any initial knowledge of neighboring robot poses. We demonstrate TCAFF being used for frame alignment in a collaborative object tracking application on a team of four robots tracking six pedestrians and show that TCAFF enables robots to achieve a tracking accuracy similar to that of a system with ground truth localization. The code and hardware dataset are available at https://github.com/mit-acl/tcaff.

However, existing approaches perform event feature extraction for RGB-E tracking using traditional appearance models, which have been optimised for RGB only tracking, without adapting it for the intrinsic characteristics of the event data. To address this problem, we propose an Event backbone (Pooler), designed to obtain a high-quality feature representation that is cognisant of the innate characteristics of the event data, namely its sparsity. In particular, Multi-Scale Pooling is introduced to capture all the motion feature trends within event data through the utilisation of diverse pooling kernel sizes. The association between the derived RGB and event representations is established by an innovative module performing adaptive Mutually Guided Fusion (MGF). Extensive experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on two widely used RGB-E tracking datasets, including VisEvent and COESOT, where the precision and success rates on COESOT are improved by 4.9% and 5.2%, respectively.

However, achieving this goal still remains challenging, primarily due to: (i) For crowded scenes with occluded objects, the high overlap of object bounding boxes leads to confusion among closely located objects. Nevertheless, humans naturally perceive the depth of elements in a scene when observing 2D videos. Inspired by this, even though the bounding boxes of objects are close on the camera plane, we can differentiate them in the depth dimension, thereby establishing a 3D perception of the objects. (ii) For videos with rapidly irregular camera motion, abrupt changes in object positions can result in ID switches. However, if the camera pose are known, we can compensate for the errors in linear motion models. In this paper, we propose \textit{DepthMOT}, which achieves: (i) detecting and estimating scene depth map \textit{end-to-end}, (ii) compensating the irregular camera motion by camera pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DepthMOT in VisDrone-MOT and UAVDT datasets. The code will be available at \url{https://github.com/JackWoo0831/DepthMOT}.

Detection-based multi-object tracking (DBT) algorithms detect objects using an independent object detector and predict the imminent location of each target. Conventional prediction methods in DBT utilize Kalman Filter(KF) to extrapolate the target location in the upcoming frames by supposing a constant velocity motion model. These methods are especially hindered in autonomous driving applications due to dramatic camera motion or unavailable detections. Such limitations lead to tracking failures manifested by numerous identity switches and disrupted trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a novel KF-based prediction module called the Ego-motion Aware Target Prediction (EMAP) module by focusing on the integration of camera motion and depth information with object motion models. Our proposed method decouples the impact of camera rotational and translational velocity from the object trajectories by reformulating the Kalman Filter. This reformulation enables us to reject the disturbances caused by camera motion and maximizes the reliability of the object motion model. We integrate our module with four state-of-the-art base MOT algorithms, namely OC-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and BoT-SORT. In particular, our evaluation on the KITTI MOT dataset demonstrates that EMAP remarkably drops the number of identity switches (IDSW) of OC-SORT and Deep OC-SORT by 73% and 21%, respectively. At the same time, it elevates other performance metrics such as HOTA by more than 5%. Our source code is available at https://github.com/noyzzz/EMAP.

Despite sharing a common goal, different tasks often rely on distinct model architectures and annotation formats. In contrast, natural language processing benefits from a unified output space, i.e., text sequences, which simplifies the training of powerful foundational language models, such as GPT-3, with extensive training corpora. Inspired by this, we seek to unify the output space of video understanding tasks by using languages as labels and additionally introducing time and box tokens. In this way, a variety of video tasks could be formulated as video-grounded token generation. This enables us to address various types of video tasks, including classification (such as action recognition), captioning (covering clip captioning, video question answering, and dense video captioning), and localization tasks (such as visual object tracking) within a fully shared encoder-decoder architecture, following a generative framework. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate such a simple and straightforward idea is quite effective and can achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results on seven video benchmarks, providing a novel perspective for more universal video understanding.

A natural and intuitive approach is to split this task into two parts: object detection and association. Most mainstream methods employ meticulously crafted heuristic techniques to maintain trajectory information and compute cost matrices for object matching. Although these methods can achieve notable tracking performance, they often require a series of elaborate handcrafted modifications while facing complicated scenarios. We believe that manually assumed priors limit the method's adaptability and flexibility in learning optimal tracking capabilities from domain-specific data. Therefore, we introduce a new perspective that treats Multiple Object Tracking as an in-context ID Prediction task, transforming the aforementioned object association into an end-to-end trainable task. Based on this, we propose a simple yet effective method termed MOTIP. Given a set of trajectories carried with ID information, MOTIP directly decodes the ID labels for current detections to accomplish the association process. Without using tailored or sophisticated architectures, our method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks by solely leveraging object-level features as tracking cues. The simplicity and impressive results of MOTIP leave substantial room for future advancements, thereby making it a promising baseline for subsequent research. Our code and checkpoints are released at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/MOTIP.

This lack of exploration is primarily due to two key challenges. Firstly, extensive pretraining on large-scale video datasets is required to equip MLLMs with the capability to perceive objects across multiple frames and understand inter-frame relationships. Secondly, processing a large number of frames within the context window of Large Language Models (LLMs) can impose a significant computational burden. To address the first challenge, we introduce ElysiumTrack-1M, a large-scale video dataset supported for three tasks: Single Object Tracking (SOT), Referring Single Object Tracking (RSOT), and Video Referring Expression Generation (Video-REG). ElysiumTrack-1M contains 1.27 million annotated video frames with corresponding object boxes and descriptions. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct training of MLLMs and propose a token-compression model T-Selector to tackle the second challenge.

Early research focused on fully fine-tuning RGB-based trackers, which was inefficient and lacked generalized representation due to the scarcity of multimodal data. Therefore, recent studies have utilized prompt tuning to transfer pre-trained RGB-based trackers to multimodal data. However, the modality gap limits pre-trained knowledge recall, and the dominance of the RGB modality persists, preventing the full utilization of information from other modalities. To address these issues, we propose a novel symmetric multimodal tracking framework called SDSTrack. We introduce lightweight adaptation for efficient fine-tuning, which directly transfers the feature extraction ability from RGB to other domains with a small number of trainable parameters and integrates multimodal features in a balanced, symmetric manner. Furthermore, we design a complementary masked patch distillation strategy to enhance the robustness of trackers in complex environments, such as extreme weather, poor imaging, and sensor failure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDSTrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various multimodal tracking scenarios, including RGB+Depth, RGB+Thermal, and RGB+Event tracking, and exhibits impressive results in extreme conditions.

Existing works primarily focus on the heuristic design of neural networks to obtain high accuracy. As tracking accuracy improves, however, neural networks become increasingly complex, posing challenges for their practical application in real driving scenarios due to the high level of latency. In this paper, we explore the use of the neural architecture search (NAS) methods to search for efficient architectures for tracking, aiming for low real-time latency while maintaining relatively high accuracy. Another challenge for object tracking is the unreliability of a single sensor, therefore, we propose a multi-modal framework to improve the robustness. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can run on edge devices within lower latency constraints, thus greatly reducing the computational requirements for multi-modal object tracking while keeping lower latency.

While Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have set the benchmark for high-performance systems, the appeal of camera-only solutions lies in their cost-effectiveness. Notably, despite the prevalent use of Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) sensors in automotive systems, their potential in 3D detection and tracking has been largely disregarded due to data sparsity and measurement noise. As a recent development, the combination of RADARs and cameras is emerging as a promising solution. This paper presents Camera-RADAR 3D Detection and Tracking (CR3DT), a camera-RADAR fusion model for 3D object detection, and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT). Building upon the foundations of the State-of-the-Art (SotA) camera-only BEVDet architecture, CR3DT demonstrates substantial improvements in both detection and tracking capabilities, by incorporating the spatial and velocity information of the RADAR sensor. Experimental results demonstrate an absolute improvement in detection performance of 5.3% in mean Average Precision (mAP) and a 14.9% increase in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) on the nuScenes dataset when leveraging both modalities. CR3DT bridges the gap between high-performance and cost-effective perception systems in autonomous driving, by capitalizing on the ubiquitous presence of RADAR in automotive applications.

Recently, slot-based video models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in segmenting and tracking objects, but they overlook the importance of the effective reasoning module. In the real world, reasoning and predictive abilities play a crucial role in human perception and object tracking; in particular, these abilities are closely related to human intuitive physics. Inspired by this, we designed a novel reasoning module called the Slot-based Time-Space Transformer with Memory buffer (STATM) to enhance the model's perception ability in complex scenes. The memory buffer primarily serves as storage for slot information from upstream modules, the Slot-based Time-Space Transformer makes predictions through slot-based spatiotemporal attention computations and fusion. Our experimental results on various datasets indicate that the STATM module can significantly enhance the capabilities of multiple state-of-the-art object-centric learning models for video.

However, current 3D trackers face issues with accuracy and latency consistency. In this paper, we propose Fast-Poly, a fast and effective filter-based method for 3D MOT. Building upon our previous work Poly-MOT, Fast-Poly addresses object rotational anisotropy in 3D space, enhances local computation densification, and leverages parallelization technique, improving inference speed and precision. Fast-Poly is extensively tested on two large-scale tracking benchmarks with Python implementation. On the nuScenes dataset, Fast-Poly achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 75.8% AMOTA among all methods and can run at 34.2 FPS on a personal CPU. On the Waymo dataset, Fast-Poly exhibits competitive accuracy with 63.6% MOTA and impressive inference speed (35.5 FPS).

Recent advancements in multi-view detection and 3D object recognition have significantly improved performance by strategically projecting all views onto the ground plane and conducting detection analysis from a Bird's Eye View. In this paper, we compare modern lifting methods, both parameter-free and parameterized, to multi-view aggregation. Additionally, we present an architecture that aggregates the features of multiple times steps to learn robust detection and combines appearance- and motion-based cues for tracking. Most current tracking approaches either focus on pedestrians or vehicles. In our work, we combine both branches and add new challenges to multi-view detection with cross-scene setups. Our method generalizes to three public datasets across two domains: (1) pedestrian: Wildtrack and MultiviewX, and (2) roadside perception: Synthehicle, achieving state-of-the-art performance in detection and tracking. https://github.com/tteepe/TrackTacular

Such temporal misalignment introduces inconsistent constraints for state estimation, leading to a significant positioning drift especially in high dynamic motion scenarios. In this article, we focus on online temporal calibration to reduce the positioning drift caused by the time offset for high dynamic motion VIO. For the time offset observation model, most existing methods rely on accurate state estimation or stable visual tracking. For the prediction model, current methods oversimplify the time offset as a constant value with white Gaussian noise. However, these ideal conditions are seldom satisfied in real high dynamic scenarios, resulting in the poor performance. In this paper, we introduce online time offset modeling networks (TON) to enhance real-time temporal calibration. TON improves the accuracy of time offset observation and prediction modeling. Specifically, for observation modeling, we propose feature velocity observation networks to enhance velocity computation for features in unstable visual tracking conditions. For prediction modeling, we present time offset prediction networks to learn its evolution pattern. To highlight the effectiveness of our method, we integrate the proposed TON into both optimization-based and filter-based VIO systems. Simulation and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the enhanced performance of our approach. Additionally, to contribute to the VIO community, we will open-source the code of our method on: https://github.com/Franky-X/FVON-TPN.

While recent learning-based optical flow methods have achieved high accuracy, they often come with heavy computation costs. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient optical flow architecture, called NeuFlow, that addresses both high accuracy and computational cost concerns. The architecture follows a global-to-local scheme. Given the features of the input images extracted at different spatial resolutions, global matching is employed to estimate an initial optical flow on the 1/16 resolution, capturing large displacement, which is then refined on the 1/8 resolution with lightweight CNN layers for better accuracy. We evaluate our approach on Jetson Orin Nano and RTX 2080 to demonstrate efficiency improvements across different computing platforms. We achieve a notable 10x-80x speedup compared to several state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach achieves around 30 FPS on edge computing platforms, which represents a significant breakthrough in deploying complex computer vision tasks such as SLAM on small robots like drones.

In this paper, we first propose a new long-term, large-scale frame-event visual object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 1,044 long-term videos that involve 1.9 million RGB frames and event stream pairs, 60 different target objects, and 14 challenging attributes. To build a solid benchmark, we retrain and evaluate 21 baseline trackers on our dataset for future work to compare. In addition, we propose a novel Associative Memory Transformer based RGB-Event long-term visual tracker, termed AMTTrack. It follows a one-stream tracking framework and aggregates the multi-scale RGB/event template and search tokens effectively via the Hopfield retrieval layer. The framework also embodies another aspect of associative memory by maintaining dynamic template representations through an associative memory update scheme, which addresses the appearance variation in long-term tracking. Extensive experiments on FELT, FE108, VisEvent, and COESOT datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed tracker.

The essence of our work lies in adapting LoRA, a technique that fine-tunes a small subset of model parameters without adding inference latency, to the domain of visual tracking. However, unique challenges and potential domain gaps make this transfer not as easy as the first intuition. Firstly, a transformer-based tracker constructs unshared position embedding for template and search image. This poses a challenge for the transfer of LoRA, usually requiring consistency in the design when applied to the pre-trained backbone, to downstream tasks. Secondly, the inductive bias inherent in convolutional heads diminishes the effectiveness of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in tracking models. To overcome these limitations, we first decouple the position embeddings in transformer-based trackers into shared spatial ones and independent type ones. The shared embeddings, which describe the absolute coordinates of multi-resolution images (namely, the template and search images), are inherited from the pre-trained backbones. In contrast, the independent embeddings indicate the sources of each token and are learned from scratch. Furthermore, we design an anchor-free head solely based on MLP to adapt PETR, enabling better performance with less computational overhead. With our design, 1) it becomes practical to train trackers with the ViT-g backbone on GPUs with only memory of 25.8GB (batch size of 16); 2) we reduce the training time of the L-224 variant from 35.0 to 10.8 GPU hours; 3) we improve the LaSOT SUC score from 0.703 to 0.742 with the L-224 variant; 4) we fast the inference speed of the L-224 variant from 52 to 119 FPS.

Common motion tracking methods based on electromagnetic tracker are however limited by their high cost and material susceptibility. In this work, the motion-guided dual-camera vision tracker is proposed to provide robust and accurate tracking of the endoscope tip's 3D position. The tracker addresses several unique challenges of tracking flexible endoscope tip inside a dynamic, life-sized mechanical simulator. To address the appearance variation and keep dual-camera tracking consistency, the cross-camera mutual template strategy (CMT) is proposed by introducing dynamic transient mutual templates. To alleviate large occlusion and light-induced distortion, the Mamba-based motion-guided prediction head (MMH) is presented to aggregate historical motion with visual tracking. The proposed tracker achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art vision trackers, achieving 42% and 72% improvements against the second-best method in average error and maximum error. Further motion analysis involving novice and expert endoscopists also shows that the tip 3D motion provided by the proposed tracker enables more reliable motion analysis and more substantial differentiation between different expertise levels, compared with other trackers.

Yet, knowing merely ''where'' is insufficient in many crucial applications. In comparison, semantic understanding such as fine-grained behaviors, interactions, and overall summarized captions (i.e., ''what'') from videos, associated with ''where'', is highly-desired for comprehensive video analysis. Thus motivated, we introduce Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT), that aims to estimate object trajectories and meanwhile understand semantic details of associated trajectories including instance captions, instance interactions, and overall video captions, integrating ''where'' and ''what'' for tracking. In order to foster the exploration of SMOT, we propose BenSMOT, a large-scale Benchmark for Semantic MOT. Specifically, BenSMOT comprises 3,292 videos with 151K frames, covering various scenarios for semantic tracking of humans. BenSMOT provides annotations for the trajectories of targets, along with associated instance captions in natural language, instance interactions, and overall caption for each video sequence. To our best knowledge, BenSMOT is the first publicly available benchmark for SMOT. Besides, to encourage future research, we present a novel tracker named SMOTer, which is specially designed and end-to-end trained for SMOT, showing promising performance. By releasing BenSMOT, we expect to go beyond conventional MOT by predicting ''where'' and ''what'' for SMOT, opening up a new direction in tracking for video understanding. We will release BenSMOT and SMOTer at https://github.com/Nathan-Li123/SMOTer.

Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet, there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study, we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians, a phenomenon we refer to as ``pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution''. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation strategies, including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) , designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes, and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems, and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance.

VastTrack possesses several attractive properties: (1) Vast Object Category. In particular, it covers target objects from 2,115 classes, largely surpassing object categories of existing popular benchmarks (e.g., GOT-10k with 563 classes and LaSOT with 70 categories). With such vast object classes, we expect to learn more general object tracking. (2) Larger scale. Compared with current benchmarks, VastTrack offers 50,610 sequences with 4.2 million frames, which makes it to date the largest benchmark regarding the number of videos, and thus could benefit training even more powerful visual trackers in the deep learning era. (3) Rich Annotation. Besides conventional bounding box annotations, VastTrack also provides linguistic descriptions for the videos. The rich annotations of VastTrack enables development of both the vision-only and the vision-language tracking. To ensure precise annotation, all videos are manually labeled with multiple rounds of careful inspection and refinement. To understand performance of existing trackers and to provide baselines for future comparison, we extensively assess 25 representative trackers. The results, not surprisingly, show significant drops compared to those on current datasets due to lack of abundant categories and videos from diverse scenarios for training, and more efforts are required to improve general tracking. Our VastTrack and all the evaluation results will be made publicly available https://github.com/HengLan/VastTrack.

Due to the lack of semantic modeling capacity in audio and video, existing works have mainly focused on text-based multi-object tracking, which often comes at the cost of tracking quality, interaction efficiency, and even the safety of assistance systems, limiting the application of such methods in autonomous driving. In this paper, we delve into the problem of AR-MOT from the perspective of audio-video fusion and audio-video tracking. We put forward EchoTrack, an end-to-end AR-MOT framework with dual-stream vision transformers. The dual streams are intertwined with our Bidirectional Frequency-domain Cross-attention Fusion Module (Bi-FCFM), which bidirectionally fuses audio and video features from both frequency- and spatiotemporal domains. Moreover, we propose the Audio-visual Contrastive Tracking Learning (ACTL) regime to extract homogeneous semantic features between expressions and visual objects by learning homogeneous features between different audio and video objects effectively. Aside from the architectural design, we establish the first set of large-scale AR-MOT benchmarks, including Echo-KITTI, Echo-KITTI+, and Echo-BDD. Extensive experiments on the established benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EchoTrack and its components.

Most existing methods perform tracking between two consecutive frames while ignoring the motion patterns of the target over a series of frames, which would cause performance degradation in the scenes with sparse points. To break through this limitation, we introduce Sequence-to-Sequence tracking paradigm and a tracker named SeqTrack3D to capture target motion across continuous frames. Unlike previous methods that primarily adopted three strategies: matching two consecutive point clouds, predicting relative motion, or utilizing sequential point clouds to address feature degradation, our SeqTrack3D combines both historical point clouds and bounding box sequences. This novel method ensures robust tracking by leveraging location priors from historical boxes, even in scenes with sparse points. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale datasets show that SeqTrack3D achieves new state-of-the-art performances, improving by 6.00% on NuScenes and 14.13% on Waymo dataset.

The majority of tracking methods follow the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, blindly trust the incoming detections with no sense of their associated localization uncertainty. This lack of uncertainty awareness poses a problem in safety-critical tasks such as autonomous driving where passengers could be put at risk due to erroneous detections that have propagated to downstream tasks, including MOT. While there are existing works in probabilistic object detection that predict the localization uncertainty around the boxes, no work in 2D MOT for autonomous driving has studied whether these estimates are meaningful enough to be leveraged effectively in object tracking. We introduce UncertaintyTrack, a collection of extensions that can be applied to multiple TBD trackers to account for localization uncertainty estimates from probabilistic object detectors. Experiments on the Berkeley Deep Drive MOT dataset show that the combination of our method and informative uncertainty estimates reduces the number of ID switches by around 19\% and improves mMOTA by 2-3%.

In this work, we propose a novel constraints-based loss for measuring the intrinsic (focal length: $(f_x, f_y)$ and principal point: $(p_x, p_y)$) and extrinsic (baseline: ($b$), disparity: ($d$), translation: $(t_x, t_y, t_z)$, and rotation specifically pitch: $(Î¸_p)$) camera parameters. Our novel constraints are based on geometric properties inherent in the camera model, including the anatomy of the projection matrix (vanishing points, image of world origin, axis planes) and the orthonormality of the rotation matrix. Thus we proposed a novel Unsupervised Geometric Constraint Loss (UGCL) via a multitask learning framework. Our methodology is a hybrid approach that employs the learning power of a neural network to estimate the desired parameters along with the underlying mathematical properties inherent in the camera projection matrix. This distinctive approach not only enhances the interpretability of the model but also facilitates a more informed learning process. Additionally, we introduce a new CVGL Camera Calibration dataset, featuring over 900 configurations of camera parameters, incorporating 63,600 image pairs that closely mirror real-world conditions. By training and testing on both synthetic and real-world datasets, our proposed approach demonstrates improvements across all parameters when compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks.

To compensate for the information loss caused by deteriorated frames, recent approaches exploit transformer-based integration modules to obtain spatio-temporal information. However, these integration modules are heavy and complex. Furthermore, each integration module is specifically tailored for its target task, making it difficult to generalise to multiple tasks. In this paper, we present a neat and unified framework, called Spatio-Temporal Prompting Network (STPN). It can efficiently extract robust and accurate video features by dynamically adjusting the input features in the backbone network. Specifically, STPN predicts several video prompts containing spatio-temporal information of neighbour frames. Then, these video prompts are prepended to the patch embeddings of the current frame as the updated input for video feature extraction. Moreover, STPN is easy to generalise to various video tasks because it does not contain task-specific modules. Without bells and whistles, STPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used datasets for different video understanding tasks, i.e., ImageNetVID for video object detection, YouTubeVIS for video instance segmentation, and GOT-10k for visual object tracking.

Our primary focus centers on illustrating this transition with the specific case of underwater object tracking. DQN offers advantages such as data efficiency and off-policy learning, while remaining simpler to implement than other reinforcement learning methods. Given the absence of a dynamic model for our robot, we propose an RL agent to control this multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system, where a centralized controller may offer more robust control than distinct PIDs. Our approach involves initially using classical controllers for safe exploration, then gradually shifting to DQN to take full control of the robot.
  We divide the underwater tracking task into vision and control modules. We use established methods for vision-based tracking and introduce a centralized DQN controller. By transmitting bounding box data from the vision module to the control module, we enable adaptation to various objects and effortless vision system replacement. Furthermore, dealing with low-dimensional data facilitates cost-effective online learning for the controller. Our experiments, conducted within a Unity-based simulator, validate the effectiveness of a centralized RL agent over separated PID controllers, showcasing the applicability of our framework for training the underwater RL agent and improved performance compared to traditional control methods. The code for both real and simulation implementations is at https://github.com/FARAZLOTFI/underwater-object-tracking.

Due to the gap between different modalities, most existing trackers are designed for single or partial of these reference settings and overspecialize on the specific modality. Differently, we present a unified tracker called UVLTrack, which can simultaneously handle all three reference settings (BBOX, NL, NL+BBOX) with the same parameters. The proposed UVLTrack enjoys several merits. First, we design a modality-unified feature extractor for joint visual and language feature learning and propose a multi-modal contrastive loss to align the visual and language features into a unified semantic space. Second, a modality-adaptive box head is proposed, which makes full use of the target reference to mine ever-changing scenario features dynamically from video contexts and distinguish the target in a contrastive way, enabling robust performance in different reference settings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that UVLTrack achieves promising performance on seven visual tracking datasets, three vision-language tracking datasets, and three visual grounding datasets.

However, most deep learning-based trackers mainly focus on designing a complicated appearance model or template updating strategy, while lacking the exploitation of context between consecutive frames and thus entailing the \textit{when-and-how-to-update} dilemma. To address these issues, we propose a novel explicit visual prompts framework for visual tracking, dubbed \textbf{EVPTrack}. Specifically, we utilize spatio-temporal tokens to propagate information between consecutive frames without focusing on updating templates. As a result, we cannot only alleviate the challenge of \textit{when-to-update}, but also avoid the hyper-parameters associated with updating strategies. Then, we utilize the spatio-temporal tokens to generate explicit visual prompts that facilitate inference in the current frame. The prompts are fed into a transformer encoder together with the image tokens without additional processing. Consequently, the efficiency of our model is improved by avoiding \textit{how-to-update}. In addition, we consider multi-scale information as explicit visual prompts, providing multiscale template features to enhance the EVPTrack's ability to handle target scale changes. Extensive experimental results on six benchmarks (i.e., LaSOT, LaSOT\rm $_{ext}$, GOT-10k, UAV123, TrackingNet, and TNL2K.) validate that our EVPTrack can achieve competitive performance at a real-time speed by effectively exploiting both spatio-temporal and multi-scale information.

Actually, only visible cameras are deployed in many practical systems, and the newly designed neuromorphic cameras may have different resolutions. The latest neuromorphic sensors can output high-definition event streams, but it is very difficult to achieve strict alignment between events and frames on both spatial and temporal views. Therefore, how to achieve accurate tracking with unaligned neuromorphic and visible sensors is a valuable but unresearched problem. In this work, we formally propose the task of object tracking using unaligned neuromorphic and visible cameras. We build the first unaligned frame-event dataset CRSOT collected with a specially built data acquisition system, which contains 1,030 high-definition RGB-Event video pairs, 304,974 video frames. In addition, we propose a novel unaligned object tracking framework that can realize robust tracking even using the loosely aligned RGB-Event data. Specifically, we extract the template and search regions of RGB and Event data and feed them into a unified ViT backbone for feature embedding. Then, we propose uncertainty perception modules to encode the RGB and Event features, respectively, then, we propose a modality uncertainty fusion module to aggregate the two modalities. These three branches are jointly optimized in the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker can collaborate the dual modalities for high-performance tracking even without strictly temporal and spatial alignment.

However, most current top-performing trackers persistently lean on sparse temporal relationships between reference and search frames via an offline mode. Consequently, they can only interact independently within each image-pair and establish limited temporal correlations. To alleviate the above problem, we propose a simple, flexible and effective video-level tracking pipeline, named \textbf{ODTrack}, which densely associates the contextual relationships of video frames in an online token propagation manner. ODTrack receives video frames of arbitrary length to capture the spatio-temporal trajectory relationships of an instance, and compresses the discrimination features (localization information) of a target into a token sequence to achieve frame-to-frame association. This new solution brings the following benefits: 1) the purified token sequences can serve as prompts for the inference in the next video frame, whereby past information is leveraged to guide future inference; 2) the complex online update strategies are effectively avoided by the iterative propagation of token sequences, and thus we can achieve more efficient model representation and computation. ODTrack achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance on seven benchmarks, while running at real-time speed. Code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/ODTrack}.

In an effort to derive a formulation for practical settings, we consider limited and unknown sensor field-of-views (FoVs), sensors with limited local computational resources and communication channel capacity. The resulting distributed multi-object tracking algorithm involves solving an NP-hard multidimensional assignment problem either optimally for small-size problems or sub-optimally for general practical problems. For general problems, we propose an efficient distributed multi-object tracking algorithm that performs track-to-track fusion using a clustering-based analysis of the state space transformed into a density space to mitigate the complexity of the assignment problem. The proposed algorithm can more efficiently group local track estimates for fusion than existing approaches. To ensure we achieve globally consistent identities for tracks across a network of nodes as objects move between FoVs, we develop a graph-based algorithm to achieve label consensus and minimise track segmentation. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is significantly more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art solutions, achieving similar tracking accuracy and bandwidth requirements but with improved label consistency.

However, the current methods for specifying the target object in the initial frame are either by 1) using a box or mask template, or by 2) providing an explicit language description. These manners are cumbersome and do not allow the tracker to have self-reasoning ability. Therefore, this work proposes a new tracking task -- Instruction Tracking, which involves providing implicit tracking instructions that require the trackers to perform tracking automatically in video frames. To achieve this, we investigate the integration of knowledge and reasoning capabilities from a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) for object tracking. Specifically, we propose a tracker called TrackGPT, which is capable of performing complex reasoning-based tracking. TrackGPT first uses LVLM to understand tracking instructions and condense the cues of what target to track into referring embeddings. The perception component then generates the tracking results based on the embeddings. To evaluate the performance of TrackGPT, we construct an instruction tracking benchmark called InsTrack, which contains over one thousand instruction-video pairs for instruction tuning and evaluation. Experiments show that TrackGPT achieves competitive performance on referring video object segmentation benchmarks, such as getting a new state-of the-art performance of 66.5 $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ on Refer-DAVIS. It also demonstrates a superior performance of instruction tracking under new evaluation protocols.

In pursuit of this objective, a novel X Modality Assisting Network (X-Net) is introduced, which explores the impact of the fusion paradigm by decoupling visual object tracking into three distinct levels, thereby facilitating subsequent processing. Initially, to overcome the challenges associated with feature learning due to significant discrepancies between RGB and thermal modalities, a plug-and-play pixel-level generation module (PGM) based on knowledge distillation learning is proposed. This module effectively generates the X modality, bridging the gap between the two patterns while minimizing noise interference. Subsequently, to optimize sample feature representation and promote cross-modal interactions, a feature-level interaction module (FIM) is introduced, integrating a mixed feature interaction transformer and a spatial dimensional feature translation strategy. Finally, to address random drifting caused by missing instance features, a flexible online optimization strategy called the decision-level refinement module (DRM) is proposed, which incorporates optical flow and refinement mechanisms. The efficacy of X-Net is validated through experiments on three benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art trackers. Notably, X-Net achieves performance gains of 0.47%/1.2% in the average of precise rate and success rate, respectively.

Previous works realize it by simply integrating an extra textual module into the multi-object tracker. However, they typically need to retrain the entire framework and have difficulties in optimization. In this work, we propose an insertable Knowledge Unification Network, termed iKUN, to enable communication with off-the-shelf trackers in a plug-and-play manner. Concretely, a knowledge unification module (KUM) is designed to adaptively extract visual features based on textual guidance. Meanwhile, to improve the localization accuracy, we present a neural version of Kalman filter (NKF) to dynamically adjust process noise and observation noise based on the current motion status. Moreover, to address the problem of open-set long-tail distribution of textual descriptions, a test-time similarity calibration method is proposed to refine the confidence score with pseudo frequency. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI dataset verify the effectiveness of our framework. Finally, to speed up the development of RMOT, we also contribute a more challenging dataset, Refer-Dance, by extending public DanceTrack dataset with motion and dressing descriptions.

Though great advances regarding Siamese-based 3D tracking have been made recently, it remains challenging to learn the correlation between the template and search branches effectively with the sparse LIDAR point cloud data. Instead of performing correlation of the two branches at just one point in the network, in this paper, we present a multi-correlation Siamese Transformer network that has multiple stages and carries out feature correlation at the end of each stage based on sparse pillars. More specifically, in each stage, self-attention is first applied to each branch separately to capture the non-local context information. Then, cross-attention is used to inject the template information into the search area. This strategy allows the feature learning of the search area to be aware of the template while keeping the individual characteristics of the template intact. To enable the network to easily preserve the information learned at different stages and ease the optimization, for the search area, we densely connect the initial input sparse pillars and the output of each stage to all subsequent stages and the target localization network, which converts pillars to bird's eye view (BEV) feature maps and predicts the state of the target with a small densely connected convolution network. Deep supervision is added to each stage to further boost the performance as well. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the popular KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art. Ablation study that shows the effectiveness of each component is provided as well. Code is available at https://github.com/liangp/MCSTN-3DSOT.

Considering the limitation of single imaging sensor, multi-modal images (RGB, Infrared, etc.) are introduced to compensate for this deficiency for all-weather object tracking in complex environments. However, as acquiring sufficient multi-modal tracking data is hard while the dominant modality changes with the open environment, most existing techniques fail to extract multi-modal complementary information dynamically, yielding unsatisfactory tracking performance. To handle this problem, we propose a novel multi-modal visual prompt tracking model based on a universal bi-directional adapter, cross-prompting multiple modalities mutually. Our model consists of a universal bi-directional adapter and multiple modality-specific transformer encoder branches with sharing parameters. The encoders extract features of each modality separately by using a frozen pre-trained foundation model. We develop a simple but effective light feature adapter to transfer modality-specific information from one modality to another, performing visual feature prompt fusion in an adaptive manner. With adding fewer (0.32M) trainable parameters, our model achieves superior tracking performance in comparison with both the full fine-tuning methods and the prompt learning-based methods.

This is because targets can drift considerably on the image plane, leading to erroneous tracking outcomes. Addressing such challenges typically requires supplementary appearance cues or Camera Motion Compensation (CMC). While these strategies are effective, they also introduce a considerable computational burden, posing challenges for real-time MOT. In response to this, we introduce UCMCTrack, a novel motion model-based tracker robust to camera movements. Unlike conventional CMC that computes compensation parameters frame-by-frame, UCMCTrack consistently applies the same compensation parameters throughout a video sequence. It employs a Kalman filter on the ground plane and introduces the Mapped Mahalanobis Distance (MMD) as an alternative to the traditional Intersection over Union (IoU) distance measure. By leveraging projected probability distributions on the ground plane, our approach efficiently captures motion patterns and adeptly manages uncertainties introduced by homography projections. Remarkably, UCMCTrack, relying solely on motion cues, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of challenging datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, DanceTrack and KITTI.

Due to the quadratic dependency on input size, directly applying self-attention to video segmentation with high-resolution input features poses significant challenges, often leading to insufficient GPU memory capacity. Consequently, modern video segmenters either extend an image segmenter without incorporating any temporal attention or resort to window space-time attention in a naive manner. In this work, we present Axial-VS, a general and simple framework that enhances video segmenters by tracking objects along axial trajectories. The framework tackles video segmentation through two sub-tasks: short-term within-clip segmentation and long-term cross-clip tracking. In the first step, Axial-VS augments an off-the-shelf clip-level video segmenter with the proposed axial-trajectory attention, sequentially tracking objects along the height- and width-trajectories within a clip, thereby enhancing temporal consistency by capturing motion trajectories. The axial decomposition significantly reduces the computational complexity for dense features, and outperforms the window space-time attention in segmentation quality. In the second step, we further employ axial-trajectory attention to the object queries in clip-level segmenters, which are learned to encode object information, thereby aiding object tracking across different clips and achieving consistent segmentation throughout the video.

In practice, most existing RGB trackers learn a single set of parameters to use them across datasets and applications. However, a similar single-model unification for multi-modality tracking presents several challenges. These challenges stem from the inherent heterogeneity of inputs -- each with modality-specific representations, the scarcity of multi-modal datasets, and the absence of all the modalities at all times. In this work, we introduce Un-Track, a Unified Tracker of a single set of parameters for any modality. To handle any modality, our method learns their common latent space through low-rank factorization and reconstruction techniques. More importantly, we use only the RGB-X pairs to learn the common latent space. This unique shared representation seamlessly binds all modalities together, enabling effective unification and accommodating any missing modality, all within a single transformer-based architecture. Our Un-Track achieves +8.1 absolute F-score gain, on the DepthTrack dataset, by introducing only +2.14 (over 21.50) GFLOPs with +6.6M (over 93M) parameters, through a simple yet efficient prompting strategy. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets with different modalities show that Un-Track surpasses both SOTA unified trackers and modality-specific counterparts, validating our effectiveness and practicality.

However, this is a challenge due the presence of occlusions. Multi-view perception approaches allow robots to overcome occlusions, but a tracking component is needed to associate the objects detected by the robot over multiple viewpoints. Most multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are designed for high frame rate sequences and struggle with the occlusions generated by robots' motions and 3D environments. In this paper, we introduce MOT-DETR, a novel approach to detect and track objects in 3D over time using a combination of convolutional networks and transformers. Our method processes 2D and 3D data, and employs a transformer architecture to perform data fusion. We show that MOT-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art multi-object tracking methods. Furthermore, we prove that MOT-DETR can leverage 3D data to deal with long-term occlusions and large frame-to-frame distances better than state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show how our method is resilient to camera pose noise that can affect the accuracy of point clouds. The implementation of MOT-DETR can be found here: https://github.com/drapado/mot-detr

Many methods have been explored to enhance tracking performance by incorporating tracking history to better handle scenarios involving target appearance variations such as deformation and occlusion. However, the utilization of historical information in existing methods is insufficient and incomprehensive, which typically requires repetitive training and introduces a large amount of computation. In this paper, we show that by providing a tracker that follows Siamese paradigm with precise and updated historical information, a significant performance improvement can be achieved with completely unchanged parameters. Based on this, we propose a historical prompt network that uses refined historical foreground masks and historical visual features of the target to provide comprehensive and precise prompts for the tracker. We build a novel tracker called HIPTrack based on the historical prompt network, which achieves considerable performance improvements without the need to retrain the entire model. We conduct experiments on seven datasets and experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art trackers on LaSOT, LaSOText, GOT-10k and NfS. Furthermore, the historical prompt network can seamlessly integrate as a plug-and-play module into existing trackers, providing performance enhancements.

Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance in visual tracking, recent single-branch trackers tend to overlook the weak prior assumptions associated with the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and inference pipeline in visual tracking. Moreover, the effectiveness of discriminative trackers remains constrained due to the adoption of the dual-branch pipeline. To tackle the inferior effectiveness of vanilla ViT, we propose an Adaptive ViT Model Prediction tracker (AViTMP) to design a customised tracking method. This method bridges the single-branch network with discriminative models for the first time. Specifically, in the proposed encoder AViT encoder, we introduce a tracking-tailored Adaptor module for vanilla ViT and a joint target state embedding to enrich the target-prior embedding paradigm. Then, we combine the AViT encoder with a discriminative transformer-specific model predictor to predict the accurate location. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitations of conventional inference practice, we present a novel inference pipeline called CycleTrack, which bolsters the tracking robustness in the presence of distractors via bidirectional cycle tracking verification. In the experiments, we evaluated AViTMP on eight tracking benchmarks for a comprehensive assessment, including LaSOT, LaSOTExtSub, AVisT, etc. The experimental results unequivocally establish that, under fair comparison, AViTMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in terms of long-term tracking and robustness.

However, traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is limited to tracking objects belonging to the pre-defined closed-set categories. Recently, Open-Vocabulary MOT (OVMOT) and Generic MOT (GMOT) are proposed to track interested objects beyond pre-defined categories with the given text prompt and template image. However, the expensive well pre-trained (vision-)language model and fine-grained category annotations are required to train OVMOT models. In this paper, we focus on GMOT and propose a simple but effective method, Siamese-DETR, for GMOT. Only the commonly used detection datasets (e.g., COCO) are required for training. Different from existing GMOT methods, which train a Single Object Tracking (SOT) based detector to detect interested objects and then apply a data association based MOT tracker to get the trajectories, we leverage the inherent object queries in DETR variants. Specifically: 1) The multi-scale object queries are designed based on the given template image, which are effective for detecting different scales of objects with the same category as the template image; 2) A dynamic matching training strategy is introduced to train Siamese-DETR on commonly used detection datasets, which takes full advantage of provided annotations; 3) The online tracking pipeline is simplified through a tracking-by-query manner by incorporating the tracked boxes in previous frame as additional query boxes. The complex data association is replaced with the much simpler Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Extensive experimental results show that Siamese-DETR surpasses existing MOT methods on GMOT-40 dataset by a large margin. Codes are avaliable at \url{https://github.com/yumu-173/Siamese-DETR}.

Over the years, end-to-end methods based on the traditional transformer structure, like MOTR, have achieved remarkable performance in multi-object tracking.

To address the aforementioned issues, this paper optimized the network architecture and proposed an effective training strategy to mitigate the problem of prolonged training times, thereby developing DecoderTracker, a novel end-to-end tracking method.

In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to narrow or even close this gap while achieving high tracking speed based on the smaller input size. To this end, we non-uniformly resize the cropped image to have a smaller input size while the resolution of the area where the target is more likely to appear is higher and vice versa. This enables us to solve the dilemma of attending to a larger visual field while retaining more raw information for the target despite a smaller input size. Our formulation for the non-uniform resizing can be efficiently solved through quadratic programming (QP) and naturally integrated into most of the crop-based local trackers. Comprehensive experiments on five challenging datasets based on two kinds of transformer trackers, \ie, OSTrack and TransT, demonstrate consistent improvements over them. In particular, applying our method to the speed-oriented version of OSTrack even outperforms its performance-oriented counterpart by 0.6% AUC on TNL2K, while running 50% faster and saving over 55% MACs.

Due to the limitations of individual sensors, the fusion of multiple sensor modalities is required to improve the overall detection capabilities. Additionally, robust motion tracking is essential for reducing the effect of sensor noise and improving state estimation accuracy. The reliability of the autonomous vehicle software becomes even more relevant in complex, adversarial high-speed scenarios at the vehicle handling limits in autonomous racing. In this paper, we present a modular multi-modal sensor fusion and tracking method for high-speed applications. The method is based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and is capable of fusing heterogeneous detection inputs to track surrounding objects consistently. A novel delay compensation approach enables to reduce the influence of the perception software latency and to output an updated object list. It is the first fusion and tracking method validated in high-speed real-world scenarios at the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021 and the Autonomous Challenge at CES (AC@CES) 2022, proving its robustness and computational efficiency on embedded systems. It does not require any labeled data and achieves position tracking residuals below 0.1 m. The related code is available as open-source software at https://github.com/TUMFTM/FusionTracking.

This paper extends the scope of continual learning research to class-incremental learning for multiple object tracking (MOT), which is desirable to accommodate the continuously evolving needs of autonomous systems. Previous solutions for continual learning of object detectors do not address the data association stage of appearance-based trackers, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previous classes' re-identification features. We introduce COOLer, a COntrastive- and cOntinual-Learning-based tracker, which incrementally learns to track new categories while preserving past knowledge by training on a combination of currently available ground truth labels and pseudo-labels generated by the past tracker. To further exacerbate the disentanglement of instance representations, we introduce a novel contrastive class-incremental instance representation learning technique. Finally, we propose a practical evaluation protocol for continual learning for MOT and conduct experiments on the BDD100K and SHIFT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that COOLer continually learns while effectively addressing catastrophic forgetting of both tracking and detection.

Despite the urge of safety in driving systems, no solution to the MOT adaptation problem to domain shift in test-time conditions has ever been proposed. However, the nature of a MOT system is manifold - requiring object detection and instance association - and adapting all its components is non-trivial. In this paper, we analyze the effect of domain shift on appearance-based trackers, and introduce DARTH, a holistic test-time adaptation framework for MOT. We propose a detection consistency formulation to adapt object detection in a self-supervised fashion, while adapting the instance appearance representations via our novel patch contrastive loss. We evaluate our method on a variety of domain shifts - including sim-to-real, outdoor-to-indoor, indoor-to-outdoor - and substantially improve the source model performance on all metrics.

Existing works either utilize aligned RGB and event data for accurate tracking or directly learn an event-based tracker. The first category needs more cost for inference and the second one may be easily influenced by noisy events or sparse spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework that can fully utilize multi-modal / multi-view information during training to facilitate knowledge transfer, enabling us to achieve high-speed and low-latency visual tracking during testing by using only event signals. Specifically, a teacher Transformer-based multi-modal tracking framework is first trained by feeding the RGB frame and event stream simultaneously. Then, we design a new hierarchical knowledge distillation strategy which includes pairwise similarity, feature representation, and response maps-based knowledge distillation to guide the learning of the student Transformer network. Moreover, since existing event-based tracking datasets are all low-resolution ($346 \times 260$), we propose the first large-scale high-resolution ($1280 \times 720$) dataset named EventVOT. It contains 1141 videos and covers a wide range of categories such as pedestrians, vehicles, UAVs, ping pongs, etc. Extensive experiments on both low-resolution (FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT), and our newly proposed high-resolution EventVOT dataset fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Probabilistic tracking algorithms, which are leading in other fields, are surprisingly absent from the leaderboards. We found that accounting for distance in target kinematics, exploiting detector confidence and modelling non-uniform clutter characteristics is critical for a probabilistic tracker to work in visual tracking. Previous probabilistic methods fail to address most or all these aspects, which we believe is why they fall so far behind current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (there are no probabilistic trackers in the MOT17 top 100). To rekindle progress among probabilistic approaches, we propose a set of pragmatic models addressing these challenges, and demonstrate how they can be incorporated into a probabilistic framework.

In most TBD-based methods, it is considered that objects of low detection confidence are highly occluded and thus it is a normal practice to directly disregard such objects or to reduce their priority in matching. In addition, appearance similarity is not a factor to consider for matching these objects. However, in terms of the detection confidence fusing classification and localization, objects of low detection confidence may have inaccurate localization but clear appearance; similarly, objects of high detection confidence may have inaccurate localization or unclear appearance; yet these objects are not further classified. In view of these issues, we propose Localization-Guided Track (LG-Track). Firstly, localization confidence is applied in MOT for the first time, with appearance clarity and localization accuracy of detection boxes taken into account, and an effective deep association mechanism is designed; secondly, based on the classification confidence and localization confidence, a more appropriate cost matrix can be selected and used; finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets.

Due to the adaptive and often reflective texture of such objects, traditional tracking algorithms that rely on general-purpose learned features suffer from reduced performance. Recent research has proposed to instill transparency awareness into existing general object trackers by fusing purpose-built features. However, with the existing fusion techniques, the addition of new features causes a change in the latent space making it impossible to incorporate transparency awareness on trackers with fixed latent spaces. For example, many of the current days transformer-based trackers are fully pre-trained and are sensitive to any latent space perturbations. In this paper, we present a new feature fusion technique that integrates transparency information into a fixed feature space, enabling its use in a broader range of trackers. Our proposed fusion module, composed of a transformer encoder and an MLP module, leverages key query-based transformations to embed the transparency information into the tracking pipeline. We also present a new two-step training strategy for our fusion module to effectively merge transparency features. We propose a new tracker architecture that uses our fusion techniques to achieve superior results for transparent object tracking. Our proposed method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art trackers on TOTB, which is the largest transparent object tracking benchmark recently released. Our results and the implementation of code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/kalyan0510/TOTEM.

For this third edition, the challenges were composed of seven vision-based tasks split into three main themes. The first theme, broadcast video understanding, is composed of three high-level tasks related to describing events occurring in the video broadcasts: (1) action spotting, focusing on retrieving all timestamps related to global actions in soccer, (2) ball action spotting, focusing on retrieving all timestamps related to the soccer ball change of state, and (3) dense video captioning, focusing on describing the broadcast with natural language and anchored timestamps. The second theme, field understanding, relates to the single task of (4) camera calibration, focusing on retrieving the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters from images. The third and last theme, player understanding, is composed of three low-level tasks related to extracting information about the players: (5) re-identification, focusing on retrieving the same players across multiple views, (6) multiple object tracking, focusing on tracking players and the ball through unedited video streams, and (7) jersey number recognition, focusing on recognizing the jersey number of players from tracklets. Compared to the previous editions of the SoccerNet challenges, tasks (2-3-7) are novel, including new annotations and data, task (4) was enhanced with more data and annotations, and task (6) now focuses on end-to-end approaches. More information on the tasks, challenges, and leaderboards are available on https://www.soccer-net.org. Baselines and development kits can be found on https://github.com/SoccerNet.

However, these state-of-the-art trackers are computationally expensive since they have a large number of model parameters and rely on specialized hardware (e.g., GPU) for faster inference. On the other hand, recent lightweight trackers are fast but are less accurate, especially on large-scale datasets. We propose a lightweight, accurate, and fast tracking algorithm using Mobile Vision Transformers (MobileViT) as the backbone for the first time. We also present a novel approach of fusing the template and search region representations in the MobileViT backbone, thereby generating superior feature encoding for target localization. The experimental results show that our MobileViT-based Tracker, MVT, surpasses the performance of recent lightweight trackers on the large-scale datasets GOT10k and TrackingNet, and with a high inference speed. In addition, our method outperforms the popular DiMP-50 tracker despite having 4.7 times fewer model parameters and running at 2.8 times its speed on a GPU.

However, the transformer-based models are under-utilized for Siamese lightweight tracking due to the computational complexity of their attention blocks. This paper proposes an efficient self and mixed attention transformer-based architecture for lightweight tracking. The proposed backbone utilizes the separable mixed attention transformers to fuse the template and search regions during feature extraction to generate superior feature encoding. Our prediction head performs global contextual modeling of the encoded features by leveraging efficient self-attention blocks for robust target state estimation. With these contributions, the proposed lightweight tracker deploys a transformer-based backbone and head module concurrently for the first time. Our ablation study testifies to the effectiveness of the proposed combination of backbone and head modules. Simulations show that our Separable Self and Mixed Attention-based Tracker, SMAT, surpasses the performance of related lightweight trackers on GOT10k, TrackingNet, LaSOT, NfS30, UAV123, and AVisT datasets, while running at 37 fps on CPU, 158 fps on GPU, and having 3.8M parameters. For example, it significantly surpasses the closely related trackers E.T.Track and MixFormerV2-S on GOT10k-test by a margin of 7.9% and 5.8%, respectively, in the AO metric.

However, existing tracking methods face challenges in accuracy and robustness dues to morphological change of fish, occlusion and complex environment. This paper proposes FishMOT(Multiple Object Tracking for Fish), a novel fish tracking approach combining object detection and IoU matching, including basic module, interaction module and refind module. Wherein, a basic module performs target association based on IoU of detection boxes between successive frames to deal with morphological change of fish; an interaction module combines IoU of detection boxes and IoU of fish entity to handle occlusions; a refind module use spatio-temporal information uses spatio-temporal information to overcome the tracking failure resulting from the missed detection by the detector under complex environment. FishMOT reduces the computational complexity and memory consumption since it does not require complex feature extraction or identity assignment per fish, and does not need Kalman filter to predict the detection boxes of successive frame. Experimental results demonstrate FishMOT outperforms state-of-the-art multi-object trackers and specialized fish tracking tools in terms of MOTA, accuracy, computation time, memory consumption, etc.. Furthermore, the method exhibits excellent robustness and generalizability for varying environments and fish numbers. The simplified workflow and strong performance make FishMOT as a highly effective fish tracking approach.

Multi-object tracking (MOT) detects the moving objects and tracks their locations frame by frame as real scenes are being captured into a video. However, it is well known that real time object tracking on the edge poses critical technical challenges, especially with edge devices of heterogeneous computing resources. This paper examines the performance issues and edge-specific optimization opportunities for object tracking. We will show that even the well trained and optimized MOT model may still suffer from random frame dropping problems when edge devices have insufficient computation resources. We present several edge specific performance optimization strategies, collectively coined as EMO, to speed up the real time object tracking, ranging from window-based optimization to similarity based optimization. Extensive experiments on popular MOT benchmarks demonstrate that our EMO approach is competitive with respect to the representative methods for on-device object tracking techniques in terms of run-time performance and tracking accuracy. EMO is released on Github at https://github.com/git-disl/EMO.

It remains challenging to localize the target from surroundings due to appearance variations, distractors, and the high sparsity of point clouds. To address these issues, prior Siamese and motion-centric trackers both require elaborate designs and solving multiple subtasks. In this paper, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective baseline method. By estimating the target motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) to perform tracking, BEVTrack demonstrates surprising simplicity from various aspects, i.e., network designs, training objectives, and tracking pipeline, while achieving superior performance. Besides, to achieve accurate regression for targets with diverse attributes (e.g., sizes and motion patterns), BEVTrack constructs the likelihood function with the learned underlying distributions adapted to different targets, rather than making a fixed Laplacian or Gaussian assumption as in previous works. This provides valuable priors for tracking and thus further boosts performance. While only using a single regression loss with a plain convolutional architecture, BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets, KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset while maintaining a high inference speed of about 200 FPS. The code will be released at https://github.com/xmm-prio/BEVTrack.

Despite its significance, underwater tracking has remained unexplored due to data inaccessibility. It poses distinct challenges; the underwater environment exhibits non-uniform lighting conditions, low visibility, lack of sharpness, low contrast, camouflage, and reflections from suspended particles. Performance of traditional tracking methods designed primarily for terrestrial or open-air scenarios drops in such conditions. We address the problem by proposing a novel underwater image enhancement algorithm designed specifically to boost tracking quality. The method has resulted in a significant performance improvement, of up to 5.0% AUC, of state-of-the-art (SOTA) visual trackers. To develop robust and accurate UVOT methods, large-scale datasets are required. To this end, we introduce a large-scale UVOT benchmark dataset consisting of 400 video segments and 275,000 manually annotated frames enabling underwater training and evaluation of deep trackers. The videos are labelled with several underwater-specific tracking attributes including watercolor variation, target distractors, camouflage, target relative size, and low visibility conditions.

In many cases, however, programming the robot to perform such tasks is technically complex and costly. To maximize the utility of robots in industrial and scientific settings, they require the ability to quickly shift from one task to another. Reinforcement learning algorithms provide the potential to enable robots to learn optimal solutions to complete new tasks without directly reprogramming them. The current state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning, however, generally relies on fast simulations and parallelization to achieve optimal performance. These are often not possible in robotics applications. Thus, a significant amount of research is required to facilitate the efficient and safe, training and deployment of industrial and scientific reinforcement learning robots. This technical report outlines our initial research into the application of deep reinforcement learning on an industrial UR10e robot. The report describes the reinforcement learning environments created to facilitate policy learning with the UR10e, a robotic arm from Universal Robots, and presents our initial results in training deep Q-learning and proximal policy optimization agents on the developed reinforcement learning environments. Our results show that proximal policy optimization learns a better, more stable policy with less data than deep Q-learning.

Joint tracking and segmentation have been attempted in some studies but they often lack full compatibility of both box and mask in initialization and prediction, and mainly focus on single-object scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Multi-object Mask-box Integrated framework for unified Tracking and Segmentation, dubbed MITS. Firstly, the unified identification module is proposed to support both box and mask reference for initialization, where detailed object information is inferred from boxes or directly retained from masks. Additionally, a novel pinpoint box predictor is proposed for accurate multi-object box prediction, facilitating target-oriented representation learning. All target objects are processed simultaneously from encoding to propagation and decoding, as a unified pipeline for VOT and VOS. Experimental results show MITS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both VOT and VOS benchmarks. Notably, MITS surpasses the best prior VOT competitor by around 6% on the GOT-10k test set, and significantly improves the performance of box initialization on VOS benchmarks.

Such capability is of necessity for glass-devices or autonomous robots to localize referred objects in the real-world. In the conventional referring expression comprehension tasks of images, however, datasets are mostly constructed based on the web-crawled data and don't reflect diverse real-world structures on the task of grounding textual expressions in diverse objects in the real world. Recently, a massive-scale egocentric video dataset of Ego4D was proposed. Ego4D covers around the world diverse real-world scenes including numerous indoor and outdoor situations such as shopping, cooking, walking, talking, manufacturing, etc. Based on egocentric videos of Ego4D, we constructed a broad coverage of the video-based referring expression comprehension dataset: RefEgo. Our dataset includes more than 12k video clips and 41 hours for video-based referring expression comprehension annotation. In experiments, we combine the state-of-the-art 2D referring expression comprehension models with the object tracking algorithm, achieving the video-wise referred object tracking even in difficult conditions: the referred object becomes out-of-frame in the middle of the video or multiple similar objects are presented in the video.

Previous methods usually adopt the matching-based or motion-centric paradigms to estimate the current target status. However, the former is sensitive to the similar distractors and the sparseness of point cloud due to relying on appearance matching, while the latter usually focuses on short-term motion clues (eg. two frames) and ignores the long-term motion pattern of target. To address these issues, we propose a mixed paradigm with two stages, named MTM-Tracker, which combines motion modeling with feature matching into a single network. Specifically, in the first stage, we exploit the continuous historical boxes as motion prior and propose an encoder-decoder structure to locate target coarsely. Then, in the second stage, we introduce a feature interaction module to extract motion-aware features from consecutive point clouds and match them to refine target movement as well as regress other target states. Extensive experiments validate that our paradigm achieves competitive performance on large-scale datasets (70.9% in KITTI and 51.70% in NuScenes). The code will be open soon at https://github.com/LeoZhiheng/MTM-Tracker.git.

In this paper, we find that the motion cue of objects along different time frames is critical in 3D multi-object tracking, which is less explored in existing monocular-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a motion-aware framework for monocular 3D MOT. To this end, we propose MoMA-M3T, a framework that mainly consists of three motion-aware components. First, we represent the possible movement of an object related to all object tracklets in the feature space as its motion features. Then, we further model the historical object tracklet along the time frame in a spatial-temporal perspective via a motion transformer. Finally, we propose a motion-aware matching module to associate historical object tracklets and current observations as final tracking results. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets to demonstrate that our MoMA-M3T achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed tracker is flexible and can be easily plugged into existing image-based 3D object detectors without re-training.

While existing MOT datasets focus on occlusion and appearance similarity, complex motion patterns are widespread yet overlooked. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset called BEE24 to highlight complex motions. Identity association algorithms have long been the focus of MOT research. Existing trackers can be categorized into two association paradigms: single-feature paradigm (based on either motion or appearance feature) and serial paradigm (one feature serves as secondary while the other is primary). However, these paradigms are incapable of fully utilizing different features. In this paper, we propose a parallel paradigm and present the Two rOund Parallel matchIng meChanism (TOPIC) to implement it. The TOPIC leverages both motion and appearance features and can adaptively select the preferable one as the assignment metric based on motion level. Moreover, we provide an Attention-based Appearance Reconstruction Module (AARM) to reconstruct appearance feature embeddings, thus enhancing the representation of appearance features. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and BEE24. Moreover, BEE24 challenges existing trackers to track multiple similar-appearing small objects with complex motions over long periods, which is critical in real-world applications such as beekeeping and drone swarm surveillance. Notably, our proposed parallel paradigm surpasses the performance of existing association paradigms by a large margin, e.g., reducing false negatives by 6% to 81% compared to the single-feature association paradigm. The introduced dataset and association paradigm in this work offer a fresh perspective for advancing the MOT field.

Most existing state-of-the-art trackers 1) merely aim for performance in ideal conditions while overlooking the real-world conditions; 2) adopt the tracking-by-detection paradigm, neglecting rich temporal contexts; 3) only integrate the temporal information into the template, where temporal contexts among consecutive frames are far from being fully utilized. To handle those problems, we propose a two-level framework (TCTrack) that can exploit temporal contexts efficiently. Based on it, we propose a stronger version for real-world visual tracking, i.e., TCTrack++. It boils down to two levels: features and similarity maps. Specifically, for feature extraction, we propose an attention-based temporally adaptive convolution to enhance the spatial features using temporal information, which is achieved by dynamically calibrating the convolution weights. For similarity map refinement, we introduce an adaptive temporal transformer to encode the temporal knowledge efficiently and decode it for the accurate refinement of the similarity map. To further improve the performance, we additionally introduce a curriculum learning strategy. Also, we adopt online evaluation to measure performance in real-world conditions. Exhaustive experiments on 8 wellknown benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TCTrack++. Real-world tests directly verify that TCTrack++ can be readily used in real-world applications.

Existing algorithms usually perform 3D scene reconstruction and target objects segmentation independently, and the performance is not fully guaranteed due to the challenge of the 3D segmentation. Here we propose an open-source one stop 3D target reconstruction and multilevel segmentation framework (OSTRA), which performs segmentation on 2D images, tracks multiple instances with segmentation labels in the image sequence, and then reconstructs labelled 3D objects or multiple parts with Multi-View Stereo (MVS) or RGBD-based 3D reconstruction methods. We extend object tracking and 3D reconstruction algorithms to support continuous segmentation labels to leverage the advances in the 2D image segmentation, especially the Segment-Anything Model (SAM) which uses the pretrained neural network without additional training for new scenes, for 3D object segmentation. OSTRA supports most popular 3D object models including point cloud, mesh and voxel, and achieves high performance for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and part segmentation on several 3D datasets. It even surpasses the manual segmentation in scenes with complex structures and occlusions. Our method opens up a new avenue for reconstructing 3D targets embedded with rich multi-scale segmentation information in complex scenes. OSTRA is available from https://github.com/ganlab/OSTRA.

Based on the substantial progress in object detection in recent years, the tracking-by-detection paradigm has become a popular choice due to its simplicity and efficiency. State-of-the-art 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) approaches typically rely on non-learned model-based algorithms such as Kalman Filter but require many manually tuned parameters. On the other hand, learning-based approaches face the problem of adapting the training to the online setting, leading to inevitable distribution mismatch between training and inference as well as suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose 3DMOTFormer, a learned geometry-based 3D MOT framework building upon the transformer architecture. We use an Edge-Augmented Graph Transformer to reason on the track-detection bipartite graph frame-by-frame and conduct data association via edge classification. To reduce the distribution mismatch between training and inference, we propose a novel online training strategy with an autoregressive and recurrent forward pass as well as sequential batch optimization. Using CenterPoint detections, our approach achieves 71.2% and 68.2% AMOTA on the nuScenes validation and test split, respectively. In addition, a trained 3DMOTFormer model generalizes well across different object detectors. Code is available at: https://github.com/dsx0511/3DMOTFormer.

Many existing MOT methods suffer from significant performance degradation in low-frame-rate videos due to significant location and appearance changes between adjacent frames. To this end, we propose to explore collaborative tracking learning (ColTrack) for frame-rate-insensitive MOT in a query-based end-to-end manner. Multiple historical queries of the same target jointly track it with richer temporal descriptions. Meanwhile, we insert an information refinement module between every two temporal blocking decoders to better fuse temporal clues and refine features. Moreover, a tracking object consistency loss is proposed to guide the interaction between historical queries. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that in high-frame-rate videos, ColTrack obtains higher performance than state-of-the-art methods on large-scale datasets Dancetrack and BDD100K, and outperforms the existing end-to-end methods on MOT17. More importantly, ColTrack has a significant advantage over state-of-the-art methods in low-frame-rate videos, which allows it to obtain faster processing speeds by reducing frame-rate requirements while maintaining higher performance.

Current popular tackers use Transformer attention to extract the template feature separately or interactively with the search region. However, separate template learning lacks communication between the template and search regions, which brings difficulty in extracting discriminative target-oriented features. On the other hand, interactive template learning produces hybrid template features, which may introduce potential distractors to the template via the cluttered search regions. To enjoy the merits of both methods, we propose a robust object modeling framework for visual tracking (ROMTrack), which simultaneously models the inherent template and the hybrid template features. As a result, harmful distractors can be suppressed by combining the inherent features of target objects with search regions' guidance. Target-related features can also be extracted using the hybrid template, thus resulting in a more robust object modeling framework. To further enhance robustness, we present novel variation tokens to depict the ever-changing appearance of target objects. Variation tokens are adaptable to object deformation and appearance variations, which can boost overall performance with negligible computation. Experiments show that our ROMTrack sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.

Most methods accomplish the task by explicitly or implicitly leveraging strong cues (i.e., spatial and appearance information), which exhibit powerful instance-level discrimination. However, when object occlusion and clustering occur, spatial and appearance information will become ambiguous simultaneously due to the high overlap among objects. In this paper, we demonstrate this long-standing challenge in MOT can be efficiently and effectively resolved by incorporating weak cues to compensate for strong cues. Along with velocity direction, we introduce the confidence and height state as potential weak cues. With superior performance, our method still maintains Simple, Online and Real-Time (SORT) characteristics. Also, our method shows strong generalization for diverse trackers and scenarios in a plug-and-play and training-free manner. Significant and consistent improvements are observed when applying our method to 5 different representative trackers. Further, with both strong and weak cues, our method Hybrid-SORT achieves superior performance on diverse benchmarks, including MOT17, MOT20, and especially DanceTrack where interaction and severe occlusion frequently happen with complex motions.

However, existing 3D MOT methods typically employ a single similarity metric and physical model to perform data association and state estimation for all objects. With large-scale modern datasets and real scenes, there are a variety of object categories that commonly exhibit distinctive geometric properties and motion patterns. In this way, such distinctions would enable various object categories to behave differently under the same standard, resulting in erroneous matches between trajectories and detections, and jeopardizing the reliability of downstream tasks (navigation, etc.). Towards this end, we propose Poly-MOT, an efficient 3D MOT method based on the Tracking-By-Detection framework that enables the tracker to choose the most appropriate tracking criteria for each object category. Specifically, Poly-MOT leverages different motion models for various object categories to characterize distinct types of motion accurately. We also introduce the constraint of the rigid structure of objects into a specific motion model to accurately describe the highly nonlinear motion of the object. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage data association strategy to ensure that objects can find the optimal similarity metric from three custom metrics for their categories and reduce missing matches. On the NuScenes dataset, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 75.4\% AMOTA. The code is available at https://github.com/lixiaoyu2000/Poly-MOT

It causes the similarity-based inter-frame association stage also be error-prone, where an uncertainty problem arises. The frame-by-frame accumulated uncertainty prevents trackers from learning the consistent feature embedding against time variation. To avoid this uncertainty problem, recent self-supervised techniques are adopted, whereas they failed to capture temporal relations. The interframe uncertainty still exists. In fact, this paper argues that though the uncertainty problem is inevitable, it is possible to leverage the uncertainty itself to improve the learned consistency in turn. Specifically, an uncertainty-based metric is developed to verify and rectify the risky associations. The resulting accurate pseudo-tracklets boost learning the feature consistency. And accurate tracklets can incorporate temporal information into spatial transformation. This paper proposes a tracklet-guided augmentation strategy to simulate tracklets' motion, which adopts a hierarchical uncertainty-based sampling mechanism for hard sample mining. The ultimate unsupervised MOT framework, namely U2MOT, is proven effective on MOT-Challenges and VisDrone-MOT benchmark. U2MOT achieves a SOTA performance among the published supervised and unsupervised trackers.

Recently, the notably increasing power of perception algorithms allows the unification of single/multiobject and box/mask-based tracking. Among them, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) attracts much attention. In this report, we propose HQTrack, a framework for High Quality Tracking anything in videos. HQTrack mainly consists of a video multi-object segmenter (VMOS) and a mask refiner (MR). Given the object to be tracked in the initial frame of a video, VMOS propagates the object masks to the current frame. The mask results at this stage are not accurate enough since VMOS is trained on several closeset video object segmentation (VOS) datasets, which has limited ability to generalize to complex and corner scenes. To further improve the quality of tracking masks, a pretrained MR model is employed to refine the tracking results. As a compelling testament to the effectiveness of our paradigm, without employing any tricks such as test-time data augmentations and model ensemble, HQTrack ranks the 2nd place in the Visual Object Tracking and Segmentation (VOTS2023) challenge.

For robotic precision spray application in vegetable farms, accurate plant phenotyping through instance segmentation and robust plant tracking are of great importance and a prerequisite for the following spray action. Regarding the robust tracking of vegetable plants, to solve the challenging problem of associating vegetables with similar color and texture in consecutive images, in this paper, a novel method of Multiple Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) is proposed for instance segmentation and tracking of multiple vegetable plants. In our approach, contour and blob features are extracted to describe unique feature of each individual vegetable, and associate the same vegetables in different images. By assigning a unique ID for each vegetable, it ensures the robot to spray each vegetable exactly once, while traversing along the farm rows. Comprehensive experiments including ablation studies are conducted, which prove its superior performance over two State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) MOTS methods. Compared to the conventional MOTS methods, the proposed method is able to re-identify objects which have gone out of the camera field of view and re-appear again using the proposed data association strategy, which is important to ensure each vegetable be sprayed only once when the robot travels back and forth. Although the method is tested on lettuce farm, it can be applied to other similar vegetables such as broccoli and canola.

Yet, current tracking methods mainly focus on simple, regular motion patterns in pedestrians or vehicles. This leaves a gap in tracking algorithms for targets with nonlinear, irregular motion, like athletes. Additionally, relying on the Kalman filter in recent tracking algorithms falls short when object motion defies its linear assumption. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel online and robust multi-object tracking approach named deep ExpansionIoU (Deep-EIoU), which focuses on multi-object tracking for sports scenarios. Unlike conventional methods, we abandon the use of the Kalman filter and leverage the iterative scale-up ExpansionIoU and deep features for robust tracking in sports scenarios. This approach achieves superior tracking performance without adopting a more robust detector, all while keeping the tracking process in an online fashion. Our proposed method demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in tracking irregular motion objects, achieving a score of 77.2% HOTA on the SportsMOT dataset and 85.4% HOTA on the SoccerNet-Tracking dataset. It outperforms all previous state-of-the-art trackers on various large-scale multi-object tracking benchmarks, covering various kinds of sports scenarios.

With the commonly used tracking-by-detection paradigm, 3D MOT has made important progress in recent years. However, these methods only use the detection boxes of the current frame to obtain trajectory-box association results, which makes it impossible for the tracker to recover objects missed by the detector. In this paper, we present TrajectoryFormer, a novel point-cloud-based 3D MOT framework. To recover the missed object by detector, we generates multiple trajectory hypotheses with hybrid candidate boxes, including temporally predicted boxes and current-frame detection boxes, for trajectory-box association. The predicted boxes can propagate object's history trajectory information to the current frame and thus the network can tolerate short-term miss detection of the tracked objects. We combine long-term object motion feature and short-term object appearance feature to create per-hypothesis feature embedding, which reduces the computational overhead for spatial-temporal encoding. Additionally, we introduce a Global-Local Interaction Module to conduct information interaction among all hypotheses and models their spatial relations, leading to accurate estimation of hypotheses. Our TrajectoryFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo 3D MOT benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/poodarchu/EFG .

Although existing tracking methods have achieved impressive performance, congestion and frequent occlusions still pose challenging problems in multi-object tracking. We reveal that performing sparse decomposition on dense scenes is a crucial step to enhance the performance of associating occluded targets. To this end, we propose a pseudo-depth estimation method for obtaining the relative depth of targets from 2D images. Secondly, we design a depth cascading matching (DCM) algorithm, which can use the obtained depth information to convert a dense target set into multiple sparse target subsets and perform data association on these sparse target subsets in order from near to far. By integrating the pseudo-depth method and the DCM strategy into the data association process, we propose a new tracker, called SparseTrack. SparseTrack provides a new perspective for solving the challenging crowded scene MOT problem. Only using IoU matching, SparseTrack achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks.

We propose a novel approach to lift 2D segments to 3D and fuse them by means of a neural field representation, which encourages multi-view consistency across frames. The core of our approach is a slow-fast clustering objective function, which is scalable and well-suited for scenes with a large number of objects. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require an upper bound on the number of objects or object tracking across frames. To demonstrate the scalability of the slow-fast clustering, we create a new semi-realistic dataset called the Messy Rooms dataset, which features scenes with up to 500 objects per scene. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on challenging scenes from the ScanNet, Hypersim, and Replica datasets, as well as on our newly created Messy Rooms dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our slow-fast clustering method.

Additionally, SAM-Track employs multimodal interaction methods that enable users to select multiple objects in videos for tracking, corresponding to their specific requirements. These interaction methods comprise click, stroke, and text, each possessing unique benefits and capable of being employed in combination. As a result, SAM-Track can be used across an array of fields, ranging from drone technology, autonomous driving, medical imaging, augmented reality, to biological analysis. SAM-Track amalgamates Segment Anything Model (SAM), an interactive key-frame segmentation model, with our proposed AOT-based tracking model (DeAOT), which secured 1st place in four tracks of the VOT 2022 challenge, to facilitate object tracking in video. In addition, SAM-Track incorporates Grounding-DINO, which enables the framework to support text-based interaction. We have demonstrated the remarkable capabilities of SAM-Track on DAVIS-2016 Val (92.0%), DAVIS-2017 Test (79.2%)and its practicability in diverse applications.

In doubles matches, coordinated positioning is crucial for maintaining control of the court and minimizing opponents' scoring opportunities. The analysis of such teamwork plays a vital role in understanding the dynamics of the game. However, previous studies have primarily focused on analyzing and assessing singles players without considering occlusion in broadcast videos. These studies have relied on discrete representations, which involve the analysis and representation of specific actions (e.g., strokes) or events that occur during the game while overlooking the meaningful spatial distribution. In this work, we present the first annotated drone dataset from top and back views in badminton doubles and propose a framework to estimate the control area probability map, which can be used to evaluate teamwork performance. We present an efficient framework of deep neural networks that enables the calculation of full probability surfaces. This framework utilizes the embedding of a Gaussian mixture map of players' positions and employs graph convolution on their poses. In the experiment, we verify our approach by comparing various baselines and discovering the correlations between the score and control area. Additionally, we propose a practical application for assessing optimal positioning to provide instructions during a game. Our approach offers both visual and quantitative evaluations of players' movements, thereby providing valuable insights into doubles teamwork.

Most LiDAR-inertial SLAM algorithms assume a static environment, leading to unreliable localization in dynamic environments. Moreover, the accurate tracking of moving objects is of great significance for the control and planning of autonomous vehicles. This study proposes LIMOT, a tightly-coupled multi-object tracking and LiDAR-inertial odometry system that is capable of accurately estimating the poses of both ego-vehicle and objects. We propose a trajectory-based dynamic feature filtering method, which filters out features belonging to moving objects by leveraging tracking results before scan-matching. Factor graph-based optimization is then conducted to optimize the bias of the IMU and the poses of both the ego-vehicle and surrounding objects in a sliding window. Experiments conducted on the KITTI tracking dataset and self-collected dataset show that our method achieves better pose and tracking accuracy than our previous work DL-SLOT and other baseline methods. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/tiev-tongji/LIMOT.

First, we present SeqTrack for RGB-based tracking. It casts visual tracking as a sequence generation task, forecasting object bounding boxes in an autoregressive manner. This differs from previous trackers, which depend on the design of intricate head networks, such as classification and regression heads. SeqTrack employs a basic encoder-decoder transformer architecture. The encoder utilizes a bidirectional transformer for feature extraction, while the decoder generates bounding box sequences autoregressively using a causal transformer. The loss function is a plain cross-entropy. Second, we introduce SeqTrackv2, a unified sequence-to-sequence framework for multi-modal tracking tasks. Expanding upon SeqTrack, SeqTrackv2 integrates a unified interface for auxiliary modalities and a set of task-prompt tokens to specify the task. This enables it to manage multi-modal tracking tasks using a unified model and parameter set. This sequence learning paradigm not only simplifies the tracking framework, but also showcases superior performance across 14 challenging benchmarks spanning five single- and multi-modal tracking tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/chenxin-dlut/SeqTrackv2.

Regarding its strong ability on image segmentation and high interactivity with different prompts, we found that it performs poorly on consistent segmentation in videos. Therefore, in this report, we propose Track Anything Model (TAM), which achieves high-performance interactive tracking and segmentation in videos. To be detailed, given a video sequence, only with very little human participation, i.e., several clicks, people can track anything they are interested in, and get satisfactory results in one-pass inference. Without additional training, such an interactive design performs impressively on video object tracking and segmentation. All resources are available on {https://github.com/gaomingqi/Track-Anything}.

However, such a network suffers from tedious hyper-parameter tuning and task misalignment, limiting the tracking performance. Towards these concerns, we propose a simple yet effective one-stage point-to-box network for point cloud-based 3D single object tracking. It synchronizes 3D proposal generation and center-ness score prediction by a parallel predictor without tedious hyper-parameters. To guide a task-aligned score ranking of proposals, a center-aware focal loss is proposed to supervise the training of the center-ness branch, which enhances the network's discriminative ability to distinguish proposals of different quality. Besides, we design a binary target classifier to identify target-relevant points. By integrating the derived classification scores with the center-ness scores, the resulting network can effectively suppress interference proposals and further mitigate task misalignment. Finally, we present a novel one-stage Siamese tracker OSP2B equipped with the designed network. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks including KITTI and Waymo SOT Dataset show that our OSP2B achieves leading performance with a considerable real-time speed.Code will be available at https://github.com/haooozi/OSP2B.

In this paper, a new end-to-end multi-object tracking framework is proposed, which integrates object detection and multi-object tracking into a single model. The proposed tracking framework eliminates the complex data association process in the classical TBD paradigm, and requires no additional training. Secondly, the regression confidence of historical trajectories is investigated, and the possible states of a trajectory (weak object or strong object) in the current frame are predicted. Then, a confidence fusion module is designed to guide non-maximum suppression for trajectories and detections to achieve ordered and robust tracking. Thirdly, by integrating historical trajectory features, the regression performance of the detector is enhanced, which better reflects the occlusion and disappearance patterns of objects in real world. Lastly, extensive experiments are conducted on the commonly used KITTI and Waymo datasets. The results show that the proposed framework can achieve robust tracking by using only a 2D detector and a 3D detector, and it is proven more accurate than many of the state-of-the-art TBD-based multi-modal tracking methods.

However, using a single seed point feature as the cue for voting fails to produce high-quality 3D proposals. Additionally, the equal treatment of seed points in the voting process, regardless of their significance, exacerbates this limitation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel transformer-based voting scheme to generate better proposals. Specifically, a global-local transformer (GLT) module is devised to integrate object- and patch-aware geometric priors into seed point features, resulting in robust and accurate cues for offset learning of seed points. To train the GLT module, we introduce an importance prediction branch that learns the potential importance weights of seed points as a training constraint. Incorporating this transformer-based voting scheme into 3D RPN, a novel Siamese method dubbed GLT-T is developed for 3D single object tracking on point clouds. Moreover, we identify that the highest-scored proposal in the Siamese paradigm may not be the most accurate proposal, which limits tracking performance. Towards this concern, we approach the binary score prediction task as a ranking problem, and design a target-aware ranking loss and a localization-aware ranking loss to produce accurate ranking of proposals. With the ranking losses, we further present GLT-T++, an enhanced version of GLT-T. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our GLT-T and GLT-T++ outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of tracking accuracy while maintaining a real-time inference speed.

Sequence-based video tasks, such as action recognition, use a video backbone to directly extract spatiotemporal features, while frame-based video tasks, such as multiple object tracking (MOT), rely on single fixed-image backbone to extract spatial features. In contrast, we propose to unify video understanding tasks into one novel streaming video architecture, referred to as Streaming Vision Transformer (S-ViT). S-ViT first produces frame-level features with a memory-enabled temporally-aware spatial encoder to serve the frame-based video tasks. Then the frame features are input into a task-related temporal decoder to obtain spatiotemporal features for sequence-based tasks. The efficiency and efficacy of S-ViT is demonstrated by the state-of-the-art accuracy in the sequence-based action recognition task and the competitive advantage over conventional architecture in the frame-based MOT task. We believe that the concept of streaming video model and the implementation of S-ViT are solid steps towards a unified deep learning architecture for video understanding.

In this paper, we propose a general learnable graph matching method to address these issues. Especially, we model the intra-view relationships as an undirected graph. Then data association turns into a general graph matching problem between graphs. Furthermore, to make optimization end-to-end differentiable, we relax the original graph matching problem into continuous quadratic programming and then incorporate training into a deep graph neural network with KKT conditions and implicit function theorem. In MOT task, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several MOT datasets. For image matching, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a popular indoor dataset, ScanNet. For point cloud registration, we also achieve competitive results. Code will be available at https://github.com/jiaweihe1996/GMTracker.

Detection boxes serve as the basis of both 2D and 3D MOT. The inevitable changing of detection scores leads to object missing after tracking. We propose a hierarchical data association strategy to mine the true objects in low-score detection boxes, which alleviates the problems of object missing and fragmented trajectories. The simple and generic data association strategy shows effectiveness under both 2D and 3D settings. In 3D scenarios, it is much easier for the tracker to predict object velocities in the world coordinate. We propose a complementary motion prediction strategy that incorporates the detected velocities with a Kalman filter to address the problem of abrupt motion and short-term disappearing. ByteTrackV2 leads the nuScenes 3D MOT leaderboard in both camera (56.4% AMOTA) and LiDAR (70.1% AMOTA) modalities. Furthermore, it is nonparametric and can be integrated with various detectors, making it appealing in real applications. The source code is released at https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack-V2.

State-of-the-arts can hardly carry on their superiority at night so far, thereby considerably blocking the broadening of visual tracking-related unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. To realize reliable UAV tracking at night, a spatial-channel Transformer-based low-light enhancer (namely SCT), which is trained in a novel task-inspired manner, is proposed and plugged prior to tracking approaches. To achieve semantic-level low-light enhancement targeting the high-level task, the novel spatial-channel attention module is proposed to model global information while preserving local context. In the enhancement process, SCT denoises and illuminates nighttime images simultaneously through a robust non-linear curve projection. Moreover, to provide a comprehensive evaluation, we construct a challenging nighttime tracking benchmark, namely DarkTrack2021, which contains 110 challenging sequences with over 100 K frames in total. Evaluations on both the public UAVDark135 benchmark and the newly constructed DarkTrack2021 benchmark show that the task-inspired design enables SCT with significant performance gains for nighttime UAV tracking compared with other top-ranked low-light enhancers. Real-world tests on a typical UAV platform further verify the practicability of the proposed approach.

To inherit the powerful representations of the foundation model, a natural modus operandi for multi-modal tracking is full fine-tuning on the RGB-based parameters. Albeit effective, this manner is not optimal due to the scarcity of downstream data and poor transferability, etc. In this paper, inspired by the recent success of the prompt learning in language models, we develop Visual Prompt multi-modal Tracking (ViPT), which learns the modal-relevant prompts to adapt the frozen pre-trained foundation model to various downstream multimodal tracking tasks. ViPT finds a better way to stimulate the knowledge of the RGB-based model that is pre-trained at scale, meanwhile only introducing a few trainable parameters (less than 1% of model parameters). ViPT outperforms the full fine-tuning paradigm on multiple downstream tracking tasks including RGB+Depth, RGB+Thermal, and RGB+Event tracking. Extensive experiments show the potential of visual prompt learning for multi-modal tracking, and ViPT can achieve state-of-the-art performance while satisfying parameter efficiency.

Existing approaches rely heavily on large, densely labeled datasets. However, annotating point clouds is both costly and time-consuming. Inspired by the great success of cycle tracking in unsupervised 2D SOT, we introduce the first semi-supervised approach to 3D SOT. Specifically, we introduce two cycle-consistency strategies for supervision: 1) Self tracking cycles, which leverage labels to help the model converge better in the early stages of training; 2) forward-backward cycles, which strengthen the tracker's robustness to motion variations and the template noise caused by the template update strategy. Furthermore, we propose a data augmentation strategy named SOTMixup to improve the tracker's robustness to point cloud diversity. SOTMixup generates training samples by sampling points in two point clouds with a mixing rate and assigns a reasonable loss weight for training according to the mixing rate. The resulting MixCycle approach generalizes to appearance matching-based trackers. On the KITTI benchmark, based on the P2B tracker, MixCycle trained with $\textbf{10\%}$ labels outperforms P2B trained with $\textbf{100\%}$ labels, and achieves a $\textbf{28.4\%}$ precision improvement when using $\textbf{1\%}$ labels.

In this work, we present a universal instance perception model of the next generation, termed UNINEXT. UNINEXT reformulates diverse instance perception tasks into a unified object discovery and retrieval paradigm and can flexibly perceive different types of objects by simply changing the input prompts. This unified formulation brings the following benefits: (1) enormous data from different tasks and label vocabularies can be exploited for jointly training general instance-level representations, which is especially beneficial for tasks lacking in training data. (2) the unified model is parameter-efficient and can save redundant computation when handling multiple tasks simultaneously. UNINEXT shows superior performance on 20 challenging benchmarks from 10 instance-level tasks including classical image-level tasks (object detection and instance segmentation), vision-and-language tasks (referring expression comprehension and segmentation), and six video-level object tracking tasks.

However, the dynamic changes in flight maneuver and viewpoint encountered in UAV tracking pose significant difficulties, e.g. , aspect ratio change, and scale variation. The conventional cross-correlation operation, while commonly used, has limitations in effectively capturing perceptual similarity and incorporates extraneous background information. To mitigate these limitations, this work presents a novel saliency-guided dynamic vision Transformer (SGDViT) for UAV tracking. The proposed method designs a new task-specific object saliency mining network to refine the cross-correlation operation and effectively discriminate foreground and background information. Additionally, a saliency adaptation embedding operation dynamically generates tokens based on initial saliency, thereby reducing the computational complexity of the Transformer architecture. Finally, a lightweight saliency filtering Transformer further refines saliency information and increases the focus on appearance information. The efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach have been thoroughly assessed through experiments on three widely-used UAV tracking benchmarks and real-world scenarios, with results demonstrating its superiority.

In this paper, we propose a new and general referring understanding task, termed referring multi-object tracking (RMOT). Its core idea is to employ a language expression as a semantic cue to guide the prediction of multi-object tracking. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to achieve an arbitrary number of referent object predictions in videos. To push forward RMOT, we construct one benchmark with scalable expressions based on KITTI, named Refer-KITTI. Specifically, it provides 18 videos with 818 expressions, and each expression in a video is annotated with an average of 10.7 objects. Further, we develop a transformer-based architecture TransRMOT to tackle the new task in an online manner, which achieves impressive detection performance and outperforms other counterparts. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/wudongming97/RMOT.

Namely, the inherent uncertainties existing in tracks and detections are overlooked. In this work, we discard the commonly used deterministic tracks and deterministic detections for data association, instead, we propose to model tracks and detections as random vectors in which uncertainties are taken into account. Then, based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence, the similarity between two multidimensional distributions, i.e. track and detection, is evaluated for data association purposes. Lastly, the level of track uncertainty is incorporated in our cost function design to guide the data association process. Comparative experiments have been conducted on two typical datasets, KITTI and nuScenes, and the results indicated that our proposed method outperformed the compared state-of-the-art 3D tracking algorithms.

One of the well-known challenges in MOT is object occlusion when an object becomes unobservant for subsequent frames. The current MOT methods store objects information, like objects' trajectory, in internal memory to recover the objects after occlusions. However, they retain short-term memory to save computational time and avoid slowing down the MOT method. As a result, they lose track of objects in some occlusion scenarios, particularly long ones. In this paper, we propose DFR-FastMOT, a light MOT method that uses data from a camera and LiDAR sensors and relies on an algebraic formulation for object association and fusion. The formulation boosts the computational time and permits long-term memory that tackles more occlusion scenarios. Our method shows outstanding tracking performance over recent learning and non-learning benchmarks with about 3% and 4% margin in MOTA, respectively. Also, we conduct extensive experiments that simulate occlusion phenomena by employing detectors with various distortion levels. The proposed solution enables superior performance under various distortion levels in detection over current state-of-art methods. Our framework processes about 7,763 frames in 1.48 seconds, which is seven times faster than recent benchmarks. The framework will be available at https://github.com/MohamedNagyMostafa/DFR-FastMOT.

Building upon the pure motion-based method OC-SORT, we achieve 1st place on MOT20 and 2nd place on MOT17 with 63.9 and 64.9 HOTA, respectively.

Although cross-view multi-object tracking has received increased attention in recent years, existing datasets still have several issues, including 1) missing real-world scenarios, 2) lacking diverse scenes, 3) owning a limited number of tracks, 4) comprising only static cameras, and 5) lacking standard benchmarks, which hinder the investigation and comparison of cross-view tracking methods. To solve the aforementioned issues, we introduce DIVOTrack: a new cross-view multi-object tracking dataset for DIVerse Open scenes with dense tracking pedestrians in realistic and non-experimental environments. Our DIVOTrack has fifteen distinct scenarios and 953 cross-view tracks, surpassing all cross-view multi-object tracking datasets currently available. Furthermore, we provide a novel baseline cross-view tracking method with a unified joint detection and cross-view tracking framework named CrossMOT, which learns object detection, single-view association, and cross-view matching with an all-in-one embedding model. Finally, we present a summary of current methodologies and a set of standard benchmarks with our DIVOTrack to provide a fair comparison and conduct a comprehensive analysis of current approaches and our proposed CrossMOT.

It can underpin a wide range of applications in augmented reality (AR), autonomy, and UI/UX. A critical component in a good digital-twin system is real-time, accurate 3D object tracking. Most existing works solve 3D object tracking through the lens of robotic grasping, employ older generations of depth sensors, and measure performance metrics that may not apply to other digital-twin applications such as in AR. In this work, we create a novel RGB-D dataset, called Digital Twin Tracking Dataset (DTTD), to enable further research of the problem and extend potential solutions towards longer ranges and mm localization accuracy. To reduce point cloud noise from the input source, we select the latest Microsoft Azure Kinect as the state-of-the-art time-of-flight (ToF) camera. In total, 103 scenes of 10 common off-the-shelf objects with rich textures are recorded, with each frame annotated with a per-pixel semantic segmentation and ground-truth object poses provided by a commercial motion capturing system. Through extensive experiments with model-level and dataset-level analysis, we demonstrate that DTTD can help researchers develop future object tracking methods and analyze new challenges.

It emphasizes spatio-temporal continuity and integrates both past and future reasoning for tracked objects. Thus, we name it "Past-and-Future reasoning for Tracking" (PF-Track). Specifically, our method adapts the "tracking by attention" framework and represents tracked instances coherently over time with object queries. To explicitly use historical cues, our "Past Reasoning" module learns to refine the tracks and enhance the object features by cross-attending to queries from previous frames and other objects. The "Future Reasoning" module digests historical information and predicts robust future trajectories. In the case of long-term occlusions, our method maintains the object positions and enables re-association by integrating motion predictions. On the nuScenes dataset, our method improves AMOTA by a large margin and remarkably reduces ID-Switches by 90% compared to prior approaches, which is an order of magnitude less.

To simplify this pipeline and unify the process of feature extraction and target information integration, in this paper, we present a compact tracking framework, termed as MixFormer, built upon transformers. Our core design is to utilize the flexibility of attention operations, and propose a Mixed Attention Module (MAM) for simultaneous feature extraction and target information integration. This synchronous modeling scheme allows to extract target-specific discriminative features and perform extensive communication between target and search area. Based on MAM, we build our MixFormer trackers simply by stacking multiple MAMs and placing a localization head on top. Specifically, we instantiate two types of MixFormer trackers, a hierarchical tracker MixCvT, and a non-hierarchical tracker MixViT. For these two trackers, we investigate a series of pre-training methods and uncover the different behaviors between supervised pre-training and self-supervised pre-training in our MixFormer trackers. We also extend the masked pre-training to our MixFormer trackers and design the competitive TrackMAE pre-training technique. Finally, to handle multiple target templates during online tracking, we devise an asymmetric attention scheme in MAM to reduce computational cost, and propose an effective score prediction module to select high-quality templates. Our MixFormer trackers set a new state-of-the-art performance on seven tracking benchmarks, including LaSOT, TrackingNet, VOT2020, GOT-10k, OTB100 and UAV123. In particular, our MixViT-L achieves AUC score of 73.3% on LaSOT, 86.1% on TrackingNet, EAO of 0.584 on VOT2020, and AO of 75.7% on GOT-10k.

Most recent advances focus on exploring attention mechanism variants for better information aggregation. We find these schemes are equivalent to or even just a subset of the basic self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we prove that the vanilla self-attention structure is sufficient for information aggregation, and structural adaption is unnecessary. The key is not the attention structure, but how to extract the discriminative feature for tracking and enhance the communication between the target and search image. Based on this finding, we adopt the basic vision transformer (ViT) architecture as our main tracker and concatenate the template and search image for feature embedding. To guide the encoder to capture the invariant feature for tracking, we attach a lightweight correlative masked decoder which reconstructs the original template and search image from the corresponding masked tokens. The correlative masked decoder serves as a plugin for the compact transform tracker and is skipped in inference. Our compact tracker uses the most simple structure which only consists of a ViT backbone and a box head, and can run at 40 fps. Extensive experiments show the proposed compact transform tracker outperforms existing approaches, including advanced attention variants, and demonstrates the sufficiency of self-attention in tracking tasks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging datasets, along with the VOT2020, UAV123, LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10k benchmarks.

Ants are the paradigmatic model system for such experiments but their lack of individually distinguishing visual features and their high colony densities make it extremely difficult to perform reliable tracking automatically. Additionally, the wide diversity of their species' appearances makes a generalized approach even harder. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-object tracker that, for the first time, employs domain adaptation to achieve the required generalisation. This approach is built upon a joint-detection-and-tracking framework that is extended by a set of domain discriminator modules integrating an adversarial training strategy in addition to the tracking loss. In addition to this novel domain-adaptive tracking framework, we present a new dataset and a benchmark for the ant tracking problem. The dataset contains 57 video sequences with full trajectory annotation, including 30k frames captured from two different ant species moving on different background patterns. It comprises 33 and 24 sequences for source and target domains, respectively. We compare our proposed framework against other domain-adaptive and non-domain-adaptive multi-object tracking baselines using this dataset and show that incorporating domain adaptation at multiple levels of the tracking pipeline yields significant improvements.

Existing color-event tracking framework usually contains multiple scattered modules which may lead to low efficiency and high computational complexity, including feature extraction, fusion, matching, interactive learning, etc. In this paper, we propose a single-stage backbone network for Color-Event Unified Tracking (CEUTrack), which achieves the above functions simultaneously. Given the event points and RGB frames, we first transform the points into voxels and crop the template and search regions for both modalities, respectively. Then, these regions are projected into tokens and parallelly fed into the unified Transformer backbone network. The output features will be fed into a tracking head for target object localization. Our proposed CEUTrack is simple, effective, and efficient, which achieves over 75 FPS and new SOTA performance. To better validate the effectiveness of our model and address the data deficiency of this task, we also propose a generic and large-scale benchmark dataset for color-event tracking, termed COESOT, which contains 90 categories and 1354 video sequences. Additionally, a new evaluation metric named BOC is proposed in our evaluation toolkit to evaluate the prominence with respect to the baseline methods. We hope the newly proposed method, dataset, and evaluation metric provide a better platform for color-event-based tracking.

Existing end-to-end methods, MOTR and TrackFormer are inferior to their tracking-by-detection counterparts mainly due to their poor detection performance. We aim to improve MOTR by elegantly incorporating an extra object detector. We first adopt the anchor formulation of queries and then use an extra object detector to generate proposals as anchors, providing detection prior to MOTR. The simple modification greatly eases the conflict between joint learning detection and association tasks in MOTR. MOTRv2 keeps the query propogation feature and scales well on large-scale benchmarks. MOTRv2 ranks the 1st place (73.4% HOTA on DanceTrack) in the 1st Multiple People Tracking in Group Dance Challenge. Moreover, MOTRv2 reaches state-of-the-art performance on the BDD100K dataset.

Meanwhile, a systematic study of the cost-performance tradeoff for the popular tracking-by-detection paradigm is still lacking. This paper introduces SMILEtrack, an innovative object tracker that effectively addresses these challenges by integrating an efficient object detector with a Siamese network-based Similarity Learning Module (SLM). The technical contributions of SMILETrack are twofold. First, we propose an SLM that calculates the appearance similarity between two objects, overcoming the limitations of feature descriptors in Separate Detection and Embedding (SDE) models. The SLM incorporates a Patch Self-Attention (PSA) block inspired by the vision Transformer, which generates reliable features for accurate similarity matching. Second, we develop a Similarity Matching Cascade (SMC) module with a novel GATE function for robust object matching across consecutive video frames, further enhancing MOT performance. Together, these innovations help SMILETrack achieve an improved trade-off between the cost ({\em e.g.}, running speed) and performance (e.g., tracking accuracy) over several existing state-of-the-art benchmarks, including the popular BYTETrack method. SMILETrack outperforms BYTETrack by 0.4-0.8 MOTA and 2.1-2.2 HOTA points on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/pingyang1117/SMILEtrack_Official

It requires no additional data or retraining. Instead, it uses the confidence score predicted by the backbone SOT network to automatically derive neighbor information and then uses this information to improve the tracking results. When tracking an occluded target, its appearance features are untrustworthy. However, a general siamese network often cannot tell whether the tracked object is occluded by reading the confidence score alone, because it could be misled by neighbors with high confidence scores. Our proposed NeighborTrack takes advantage of unoccluded neighbors' information to reconfirm the tracking target and reduces false tracking when the target is occluded. It not only reduces the impact caused by occlusion, but also fixes tracking problems caused by object appearance changes. NeighborTrack is agnostic to SOT networks and post-processing methods. For the VOT challenge dataset commonly used in short-term object tracking, we improve three famous SOT networks, Ocean, TransT, and OSTrack, by an average of ${1.92\%}$ EAO and ${2.11\%}$ robustness. For the mid- and long-term tracking experiments based on OSTrack, we achieve state-of-the-art ${72.25\%}$ AUC on LaSOT and ${75.7\%}$ AO on GOT-10K.

This causes tracking to inevitably fail in fast-changing and crowded scenes, as it cannot account for changes in object appearance between frames. To this end, we revamped the tracking framework with Progressive Context Encoding Transformer Tracker (ProContEXT), which coherently exploits spatial and temporal contexts to predict object motion trajectories. Specifically, ProContEXT leverages a context-aware self-attention module to encode the spatial and temporal context, refining and updating the multi-scale static and dynamic templates to progressively perform accurately tracking. It explores the complementary between spatial and temporal context, raising a new pathway to multi-context modeling for transformer-based trackers. In addition, ProContEXT revised the token pruning technique to reduce computational complexity. Extensive experiments on popular benchmark datasets such as GOT-10k and TrackingNet demonstrate that the proposed ProContEXT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, in the task of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), leveraging the power of Transformers remains relatively unexplored. Among the pioneering efforts in this domain, TransCenter, a Transformer-based MOT architecture with dense object queries, demonstrated exceptional tracking capabilities while maintaining reasonable runtime. Nonetheless, one critical aspect in MOT, track displacement estimation, presents room for enhancement to further reduce association errors. In response to this challenge, our paper introduces a novel improvement to TransCenter. We propose a post-processing mechanism grounded in the Track-by-Detection paradigm, aiming to refine the track displacement estimation. Our approach involves the integration of a carefully designed Kalman filter, which incorporates Transformer outputs into measurement error estimation, and the use of an embedding network for target re-identification. This combined strategy yields substantial improvement in the accuracy and robustness of the tracking process. We validate our contributions through comprehensive experiments on the MOTChallenge datasets MOT17 and MOT20, where our proposed approach outperforms other Transformer-based trackers.

Existing works tend to design a single tracking algorithm to perform both detection and association. Though ensemble learning has been exploited in many tasks, i.e, classification and object detection, it hasn't been studied in the MOT task, which is mainly caused by its complexity and evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective ensemble method for MOT, called EnsembleMOT, which merges multiple tracking results from various trackers with spatio-temporal constraints. Meanwhile, several post-processing procedures are applied to filter out abnormal results. Our method is model-independent and doesn't need the learning procedure. What's more, it can easily work in conjunction with other algorithms, e.g., tracklets interpolation. Experiments on the MOT17 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, given a limited amount of annotated RGB-D tracking data, most state-of-the-art RGB-D trackers are simple extensions of high-performance RGB-only trackers, without fully exploiting the underlying potential of the depth channel in the offline training stage. To address the dataset deficiency issue, a new RGB-D dataset named RGBD1K is released in this paper. The RGBD1K contains 1,050 sequences with about 2.5M frames in total. To demonstrate the benefits of training on a larger RGB-D data set in general, and RGBD1K in particular, we develop a transformer-based RGB-D tracker, named SPT, as a baseline for future visual object tracking studies using the new dataset. The results, of extensive experiments using the SPT tracker emonstrate the potential of the RGBD1K dataset to improve the performance of RGB-D tracking, inspiring future developments of effective tracker designs.

To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/psaltaath/tadn-mot.

In the flourishing field of multi-view 3D camera-based detectors, different transformer-based pipelines are designed to learn queries in 3D space from 2D feature maps of perspective views, but the dominant dense BEV query mechanism is computationally inefficient. This paper proposes Sparse R-CNN 3D (SRCN3D), a novel two-stage fully-sparse detector that incorporates sparse queries, sparse attention with box-wise sampling, and sparse prediction. SRCN3D adopts a cascade structure with the twin-track update of both a fixed number of query boxes and latent query features. Our novel sparse feature sampling module only utilizes local 2D region of interest (RoI) features calculated by the projection of 3D query boxes for further box refinement, leading to a fully-convolutional and deployment-friendly pipeline. For multi-object tracking, motion features, query features and RoI features are comprehensively utilized in multi-hypotheses data association. Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate that SRCN3D achieves competitive performance in both 3D object detection and multi-object tracking tasks, while also exhibiting superior efficiency compared to transformer-based methods.

This work proposes a solution to reduce the dependence on labelled 3D training data by leveraging pre-training on large-scale unlabeled outdoor LiDAR point clouds using masked autoencoders (MAE). While existing masked point autoencoding methods mainly focus on small-scale indoor point clouds or pillar-based large-scale outdoor LiDAR data, our approach introduces a new self-supervised masked occupancy pre-training method called Occupancy-MAE, specifically designed for voxel-based large-scale outdoor LiDAR point clouds. Occupancy-MAE takes advantage of the gradually sparse voxel occupancy structure of outdoor LiDAR point clouds and incorporates a range-aware random masking strategy and a pretext task of occupancy prediction. By randomly masking voxels based on their distance to the LiDAR and predicting the masked occupancy structure of the entire 3D surrounding scene, Occupancy-MAE encourages the extraction of high-level semantic information to reconstruct the masked voxel using only a small number of visible voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Occupancy-MAE across several downstream tasks. For 3D object detection, Occupancy-MAE reduces the labelled data required for car detection on the KITTI dataset by half and improves small object detection by approximately 2% in AP on the Waymo dataset. For 3D semantic segmentation, Occupancy-MAE outperforms training from scratch by around 2% in mIoU. For multi-object tracking, Occupancy-MAE enhances training from scratch by approximately 1% in terms of AMOTA and AMOTP. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/chaytonmin/Occupancy-MAE.

Computing detection-based measures like the F-measure on a frame-by-frame basis is not sufficient to assess the overall performance, as it does not interpret performance in the temporal domain. The main evaluation metric available comes from Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods to benchmark performance on datasets such as KITTI with the recently proposed higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) metric, which is capable of providing a better description of the performance over metrics such as MOTA, DetA, and IDF1. While the HOTA metric takes into account temporal associations, it does not provide a tailored means to analyse the spatial associations of a dataset in a multi-camera setup. Moreover, there are differences in evaluating the detection task for points when compared to objects (point distances vs. bounding box overlap). Therefore in this work, we propose a multi-view higher order tracking metric (mvHOTA) to determine the accuracy of multi-point (multi-instance and multi-class) tracking methods, while taking into account temporal and spatial associations.mvHOTA can be interpreted as the geometric mean of detection, temporal, and spatial associations, thereby providing equal weighting to each of the factors. We demonstrate the use of this metric to evaluate the tracking performance on an endoscopic point detection dataset from a previously organised surgical data science challenge. Furthermore, we compare with other adjusted MOT metrics for this use-case, discuss the properties of mvHOTA, and show how the proposed multi-view Association and the Occlusion index (OI) facilitate analysis of methods with respect to handling of occlusions.

For association, most models resourced to motion and appearance cues, e.g., re-identification networks. Recent approaches based on attention propose to learn the cues in a data-driven manner, showing impressive results. In this paper, we ask ourselves whether simple good old TbD methods are also capable of achieving the performance of end-to-end models. To this end, we propose two key ingredients that allow a standard re-identification network to excel at appearance-based tracking. We extensively analyse its failure cases, and show that a combination of our appearance features with a simple motion model leads to strong tracking results. Our tracker generalizes to four public datasets, namely MOT17, MOT20, BDD100k, and DanceTrack, achieving state-of-the-art performance. https://github.com/dvl-tum/GHOST.

However, the features may not be discriminative enough for a tracker to identify a target from a large number of detections. Selecting only high-scored detections for tracking may lead to missed detections whose confidence score is low. Consequently, in the online setting, this results in disconnections of tracklets which cannot be recovered. In this regard, we present Sparse Graph Tracker (SGT), a novel online graph tracker using higher-order relational features which are more discriminative by aggregating the features of neighboring detections and their relations. SGT converts video data into a graph where detections, their connections, and the relational features of two connected nodes are represented by nodes, edges, and edge features, respectively. The strong edge features allow SGT to track targets with tracking candidates selected by top-K scored detections with large K. As a result, even low-scored detections can be tracked, and the missed detections are also recovered. The robustness of K value is shown through the extensive experiments. In the MOT16/17/20 and HiEve Challenge, SGT outperforms the state-of-the-art trackers with real-time inference speed. Especially, a large improvement in MOTA is shown in the MOT20 and HiEve Challenge. Code is available at https://github.com/HYUNJS/SGT.

While this assumption is acceptable for very short periods of occlusion, linear estimates of motion for prolonged time can be highly inaccurate. Moreover, when there is no measurement available to update Kalman filter parameters, the standard convention is to trust the priori state estimations for posteriori update. This leads to the accumulation of errors during a period of occlusion. The error causes significant motion direction variance in practice. In this work, we show that a basic Kalman filter can still obtain state-of-the-art tracking performance if proper care is taken to fix the noise accumulated during occlusion. Instead of relying only on the linear state estimate (i.e., estimation-centric approach), we use object observations (i.e., the measurements by object detector) to compute a virtual trajectory over the occlusion period to fix the error accumulation of filter parameters during the occlusion period. This allows more time steps to correct errors accumulated during occlusion. We name our method Observation-Centric SORT (OC-SORT). It remains Simple, Online, and Real-Time but improves robustness during occlusion and non-linear motion. Given off-the-shelf detections as input, OC-SORT runs at 700+ FPS on a single CPU. It achieves state-of-the-art on multiple datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, KITTI, head tracking, and especially DanceTrack where the object motion is highly non-linear.

However, it is non-trivial to perform accurate target-specific detection since the point cloud of objects in raw LiDAR scans is usually sparse and incomplete. In this paper, we address this issue by explicitly leveraging temporal motion cues and propose DMT, a Detector-free Motion-prediction-based 3D Tracking network that completely removes the usage of complicated 3D detectors and is lighter, faster, and more accurate than previous trackers. Specifically, the motion prediction module is first introduced to estimate a potential target center of the current frame in a point-cloud-free manner. Then, an explicit voting module is proposed to directly regress the 3D box from the estimated target center. Extensive experiments on KITTI and NuScenes datasets demonstrate that our DMT can still achieve better performance (~10% improvement over the NuScenes dataset) and a faster tracking speed (i.e., 72 FPS) than state-of-the-art approaches without applying any complicated 3D detectors.

However, the existing methods tend to use various basic models (e.g, detector and embedding model), and different training or inference tricks, etc. As a result, the construction of a good baseline for a fair comparison is essential. In this paper, a classic tracker, i.e., DeepSORT, is first revisited, and then is significantly improved from multiple perspectives such as object detection, feature embedding, and trajectory association. The proposed tracker, named StrongSORT, contributes a strong and fair baseline for the MOT community. Moreover, two lightweight and plug-and-play algorithms are proposed to address two inherent "missing" problems of MOT: missing association and missing detection. Specifically, unlike most methods, which associate short tracklets into complete trajectories at high computation complexity, we propose an appearance-free link model (AFLink) to perform global association without appearance information, and achieve a good balance between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a Gaussian-smoothed interpolation (GSI) based on Gaussian process regression to relieve the missing detection. AFLink and GSI can be easily plugged into various trackers with a negligible extra computational cost (1.7 ms and 7.1 ms per image, respectively, on MOT17). Finally, by fusing StrongSORT with AFLink and GSI, the final tracker (StrongSORT++) achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple public benchmarks, i.e., MOT17, MOT20, DanceTrack and KITTI. Codes are available at https://github.com/dyhBUPT/StrongSORT and https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmtracking.

Meanwhile, most deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that are crafted with small perturbations but could mislead the model prediction. In this work, we observe that the robustness on the MOT trackers is rarely studied, and it is challenging to attack the MOT system since its mature association algorithms are designed to be robust against errors during the tracking. To this end, we analyze the vulnerability of popular MOT trackers and propose a novel adversarial attack method called Tracklet-Switch (TraSw) against the complete tracking pipeline of MOT. The proposed TraSw can fool the advanced deep pedestrian trackers (i.e., FairMOT and ByteTrack), causing them fail to track the targets in the subsequent frames by perturbing very few frames. Experiments on the MOT-Challenge datasets (i.e., 2DMOT15, MOT17, and MOT20) show that TraSw can achieve an extraordinarily high success attack rate of over 95% by attacking only four frames on average. To our knowledge, this is the first work on the adversarial attack against the pedestrian MOT trackers. Code is available at https://github.com/JHL-HUST/TraSw .

In practice, visible cameras can better perceive texture details and slow motion, while event cameras can be free from motion blurs and have a larger dynamic range which enables them to work well under fast motion and low illumination. Therefore, the two sensors can cooperate with each other to achieve more reliable object tracking. In this work, we propose a large-scale Visible-Event benchmark (termed VisEvent) due to the lack of a realistic and scaled dataset for this task. Our dataset consists of 820 video pairs captured under low illumination, high speed, and background clutter scenarios, and it is divided into a training and a testing subset, each of which contains 500 and 320 videos, respectively. Based on VisEvent, we transform the event flows into event images and construct more than 30 baseline methods by extending current single-modality trackers into dual-modality versions. More importantly, we further build a simple but effective tracking algorithm by proposing a cross-modality transformer, to achieve more effective feature fusion between visible and event data. Extensive experiments on the proposed VisEvent dataset, FE108, COESOT, and two simulated datasets (i.e., OTB-DVS and VOT-DVS), validated the effectiveness of our model. The dataset and source code have been released on: \url{https://github.com/wangxiao5791509/VisEvent_SOT_Benchmark}.

Traditional 3D tracking systems are typically constrained by predefined object categories, limiting their adaptability to novel, unseen objects in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we introduce open-vocabulary 3D tracking, which extends the scope of 3D tracking to include objects beyond predefined categories. We formulate the problem of open-vocabulary 3D tracking and introduce dataset splits designed to represent various open-vocabulary scenarios. We propose a novel approach that integrates open-vocabulary capabilities into a 3D tracking framework, allowing for generalization to unseen object classes. Our method effectively reduces the performance gap between tracking known and novel objects through strategic adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our method in diverse outdoor driving scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address open-vocabulary 3D tracking, presenting a significant advancement for autonomous systems in real-world settings.

Despite the recent promising progress, current MOT research is still limited to a fixed sampling frame rate of the input stream. In fact, we empirically found that the accuracy of all recent state-of-the-art trackers drops dramatically when the input frame rate changes. For a more intelligent tracking solution, we shift the attention of our research work to the problem of Frame Rate Agnostic MOT (FraMOT), which takes frame rate insensitivity into consideration. In this paper, we propose a Frame Rate Agnostic MOT framework with a Periodic training Scheme (FAPS) to tackle the FraMOT problem for the first time. Specifically, we propose a Frame Rate Agnostic Association Module (FAAM) that infers and encodes the frame rate information to aid identity matching across multi-frame-rate inputs, improving the capability of the learned model in handling complex motion-appearance relations in FraMOT. Moreover, the association gap between training and inference is enlarged in FraMOT because those post-processing steps not included in training make a larger difference in lower frame rate scenarios. To address it, we propose Periodic Training Scheme (PTS) to reflect all post-processing steps in training via tracking pattern matching and fusion. Along with the proposed approaches, we make the first attempt to establish an evaluation method for this new task of FraMOT in two different modes, i.e., known frame rate and unknown frame rate, aiming to handle a more complex situation. The quantitative experiments on the challenging MOT17/20 dataset (FraMOT version) have clearly demonstrated that the proposed approaches can handle different frame rates better and thus improve the robustness against complicated scenarios.

Depending on whether the initial states of target objects are specified by provided annotations in the first frame or the categories, OT could be classified as instance tracking (e.g., SOT and VOS) and category tracking (e.g., MOT, MOTS, and VIS) tasks. Combing the advantages of the best practices developed in both communities, we propose a novel tracking-with-detection paradigm, where tracking supplements appearance priors for detection and detection provides tracking with candidate bounding boxes for association. Equipped with such a design, a unified tracking model, OmniTracker, is further presented to resolve all the tracking tasks with a fully shared network architecture, model weights, and inference pipeline. Extensive experiments on 7 tracking datasets, including LaSOT, TrackingNet, DAVIS16-17, MOT17, MOTS20, and YTVIS19, demonstrate that OmniTracker achieves on-par or even better results than both task-specific and unified tracking models.

Existing work based on interacting multiple model (IMM) achieves more accurate estimation than single-filter approaches through model combination, aligning appropriate models for different motion modes of the target object over time. However, two limitations of conventional IMM remain unsolved. First, the solution space of the model combination is constrained as the target's diverse kinematic properties in different directions are ignored. Second, the model combination weights calculated by the observation likelihood are not accurate enough due to the measurement uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DIMM, to effectively combine estimates from different motion models in each direction, thus increasing the 3D object tracking accuracy. First, DIMM extends the model combination solution space of conventional IMM from a hyperplane to a hypercube by designing a 3D-decoupled multi-hierarchy filter bank, which describes the target's motion with various-order linear models. Second, DIMM generates more reliable combination weight matrices through a differentiable adaptive fusion network for importance allocation rather than solely relying on the observation likelihood; it contains an attention-based twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method with a hierarchical reward. Experiments demonstrate that DIMM significantly improves the tracking accuracy of existing state estimation methods by 31.61%~99.23%.

Among these foundation models, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), introduced by Meta AI Research, stands out as a groundbreaking solution for object segmentation tasks. While SAM has shown success in various agricultural applications, its potential in the poultry industry, specifically in the context of cage-free hens, remains relatively unexplored. This study aims to assess the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM on representative chicken segmentation tasks, including part-based segmentation and the use of infrared thermal images, and to explore chicken-tracking tasks by using SAM as a segmentation tool. The results demonstrate SAM's superior performance compared to SegFormer and SETR in both whole and part-based chicken segmentation. SAM-based object tracking also provides valuable data on the behavior and movement patterns of broiler birds. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of SAM's potential in poultry science and lay the foundation for future advancements in chicken segmentation and tracking.

Among them, graph-based tracking-by-detection paradigms achieve surprising performance. However, their fully-connected nature poses storage space requirements that challenge algorithm handling long videos. Currently, commonly used methods are still generated trajectories by building one-forward associations across frames. Such matches produced under the guidance of first-order similarity information may not be optimal from a longer-time perspective. Moreover, they often lack an end-to-end scheme for correcting mismatches. This paper proposes the Composite Node Message Passing Network (CoNo-Link), a multi-scene generalized framework for modeling ultra-long frames information for association. CoNo-Link's solution is a low-storage overhead method for building constrained connected graphs. In addition to the previous method of treating objects as nodes, the network innovatively treats object trajectories as nodes for information interaction, improving the graph neural network's feature representation capability. Specifically, we formulate the graph-building problem as a top-k selection task for some reliable objects or trajectories. Our model can learn better predictions on longer-time scales by adding composite nodes. As a result, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in several commonly used datasets.

While cooperative multi-user SLAM has demonstrated potential in leveraging distributed sensing, its application within multi-modal ISAC systems remains limited, particularly in terms of theoretical modeling and communication-layer integration. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal SLAM framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions. First, a Bayesian estimation framework is developed for cooperative multi-user SLAM, along with a two-stage algorithm for robust radio map construction under dynamic and heterogeneous sensing conditions. Second, a multi-modal localization strategy is introduced, fusing SLAM results with camera-based multi-object tracking and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data via an error-aware model, significantly improving UE localization in multi-user scenarios. Third, a sensing-aided beam management scheme is proposed, utilizing global radio maps and localization data to generate UE-specific prior information for beam selection, thereby reducing inter-user interference and enhancing downlink spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system improves radio map accuracy by up to 60%, enhances localization accuracy by 37.5%, and significantly outperforms traditional methods in both indoor and outdoor environments.

Conveniently capturing the interactions between us humans and these objects remains far-reaching. In this paper, we present I'm-HOI, a monocular scheme to faithfully capture the 3D motions of both the human and object in a novel setting: using a minimal amount of RGB camera and object-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). It combines general motion inference and category-aware refinement. For the former, we introduce a holistic human-object tracking method to fuse the IMU signals and the RGB stream and progressively recover the human motions and subsequently the companion object motions. For the latter, we tailor a category-aware motion diffusion model, which is conditioned on both the raw IMU observations and the results from the previous stage under over-parameterization representation. It significantly refines the initial results and generates vivid body, hand, and object motions. Moreover, we contribute a large dataset with ground truth human and object motions, dense RGB inputs, and rich object-mounted IMU measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of I'm-HOI under a hybrid capture setting. Our dataset and code will be released to the community.

To address this, we present VideoVista, a video QA benchmark that integrates challenges across diverse content categories, durations, and abilities. Specifically, VideoVista comprises 25,000 questions derived from 3,400 videos spanning 14 categories (e.g., Howto, Film, and Entertainment) with durations ranging from a few seconds to over 10 minutes. Besides, it encompasses 19 types of understanding tasks (e.g., anomaly detection, interaction understanding) and 8 reasoning tasks (e.g., logical reasoning, causal reasoning). To achieve this, we present an automatic data construction framework, leveraging powerful GPT-4o alongside advanced analysis tools (e.g., video splitting, object segmenting, and tracking). We also utilize this framework to construct training data to enhance the capabilities of video-related LMMs (Video-LMMs). Through a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of cutting-edge models, we reveal that: 1) Video-LMMs face difficulties in fine-grained video tasks involving temporal location, object tracking, and anomaly detection; 2) Video-LMMs present inferior logical and relation reasoning abilities; 3) Open-source Video-LMMs' performance is significantly lower than GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5, lagging by 20 points. This highlights the crucial role VideoVista will play in advancing LMMs that can accurately understand videos and perform precise reasoning.

Recent research has shown that the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) cooperative perception system has great potential to revolutionize the autonomous flight industry. However, the lack of a large-scale dataset is hindering progress in this area. This paper presents U2UData, the first large-scale cooperative perception dataset for swarm UAVs autonomous flight. The dataset was collected by three UAVs flying autonomously in the U2USim, covering a 9 km$^2$ flight area. It comprises 315K LiDAR frames, 945K RGB and depth frames, and 2.41M annotated 3D bounding boxes for 3 classes. It also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values covering all flight routes. U2USim is the first real-world mapping swarm UAVs simulation environment. It takes Yunnan Province as the prototype and includes 4 terrains, 7 weather conditions, and 8 sensor types. U2UData introduces two perception tasks: cooperative 3D object detection and cooperative 3D object tracking.

In this paper, we analyze the limitations of traditional Convolutional Neural Network-based methods and Transformer-based methods in handling occlusions and propose DNMOT, an end-to-end trainable DeNoising Transformer for MOT. To address the challenge of occlusions, we explicitly simulate the scenarios when occlusions occur. Specifically, we augment the trajectory with noises during training and make our model learn the denoising process in an encoder-decoder architecture, so that our model can exhibit strong robustness and perform well under crowded scenes. Additionally, we propose a Cascaded Mask strategy to better coordinate the interaction between different types of queries in the decoder to prevent the mutual suppression between neighboring trajectories under crowded scenes. Notably, the proposed method requires no additional modules like matching strategy and motion state estimation in inference. We conduct extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets, and the experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin.

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9).

Current approaches all follow the Siamese paradigm based on appearance matching. However, LiDAR point clouds are usually textureless and incomplete, which hinders effective appearance matching. Besides, previous methods greatly overlook the critical motion clues among targets. In this work, beyond 3D Siamese tracking, we introduce a motion-centric paradigm to handle LiDAR SOT from a new perspective. Following this paradigm, we propose a matching-free two-stage tracker M^2-Track. At the 1st-stage, M^2-Track localizes the target within successive frames via motion transformation. Then it refines the target box through motion-assisted shape completion at the 2nd-stage. Due to the motion-centric nature, our method shows its impressive generalizability with limited training labels and provides good differentiability for end-to-end cycle training. This inspires us to explore semi-supervised LiDAR SOT by incorporating a pseudo-label-based motion augmentation and a self-supervised loss term. Under the fully-supervised setting, extensive experiments confirm that M^2-Track significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on three large-scale datasets while running at 57FPS (~3%, ~11% and ~22% precision gains on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset respectively). While under the semi-supervised setting, our method performs on par with or even surpasses its fully-supervised counterpart using fewer than half of the labels from KITTI. Further analysis verifies each component's effectiveness and shows the motion-centric paradigm's promising potential for auto-labeling and unsupervised domain adaptation.

Despite these advances, we find that present-day VLMs (including the proprietary GPT-4o) lack a fundamental cognitive ability: learning to localize specific objects in a scene by taking into account the context. In this work, we focus on the task of few-shot personalized localization, where a model is given a small set of annotated images (in-context examples) -- each with a category label and bounding box -- and is tasked with localizing the same object type in a query image. Personalized localization can be particularly important in cases of ambiguity of several related objects that can respond to a text or an object that is hard to describe with words. To provoke personalized localization abilities in models, we present a data-centric solution that fine-tunes them using carefully curated data from video object tracking datasets. By leveraging sequences of frames tracking the same object across multiple shots, we simulate instruction-tuning dialogues that promote context awareness. To reinforce this, we introduce a novel regularization technique that replaces object labels with pseudo-names, ensuring the model relies on visual context rather than prior knowledge. Our method significantly enhances the few-shot localization performance of recent VLMs ranging from 7B to 72B in size, without sacrificing generalization, as demonstrated on several benchmarks tailored towards evaluating personalized localization abilities. This work is the first to explore and benchmark personalized few-shot localization for VLMs -- exposing critical weaknesses in present-day VLMs, and laying a foundation for future research in context-driven vision-language applications.

The segmentation and tracking of moving objects are essential for reliable path planning, including collision avoidance. We investigate this estimation task for vehicles using radar sensing. We address moving instance tracking in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene interpretation. We propose a learning-based radar tracker incorporating temporal offset predictions to enable direct center-based association and enhance segmentation performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based tracking for sparse radar scans to include appearance features and enhance performance. The final association combines geometric and appearance features to overcome the limitations of center-based tracking to associate instances reliably. Our approach shows an improved performance on the moving instance tracking benchmark of the RadarScenes dataset compared to the current state of the art.

Although promising tracking performance is achieved through leveraging complementary cues from different sources, it remains challenging in complex scenes due to the limitations of bi-modal scenarios. In this work, we introduce a general multimodal visual tracking task that fully exploits the advantages of four modalities, including RGB, thermal infrared, event, and language, for robust tracking under challenging conditions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation platform for general multimodal visual tracking, we construct QuadTrack600, a large-scale, high-quality benchmark comprising 600 video sequences (totaling 384.7K high-resolution (640x480) frame groups). In each frame group, all four modalities are spatially aligned and meticulously annotated with bounding boxes, while 21 sequence-level challenge attributes are provided for detailed performance analysis. Despite quad-modal data provides richer information, the differences in information quantity among modalities and the computational burden from four modalities are two challenging issues in fusing four modalities. To handle these issues, we propose a novel approach called QuadFusion, which incorporates an efficient Multiscale Fusion Mamba with four different scanning scales to achieve sufficient interactions of the four modalities while overcoming the exponential computational burden, for general multimodal visual tracking. Extensive experiments on the QuadTrack600 dataset and three bi-modal tracking datasets, including LasHeR, VisEvent, and TNL2K, validate the effectiveness of our QuadFusion.

However, existing tracking methods face some difficulties in adapting to significant target appearance variations in the presence of modality switch. For instance, model update based tracking methods struggle to maintain stable tracking results during modality switching, leading to error accumulation and model drift. Template based tracking methods solely rely on the template information from first frame and/or last frame, which lacks sufficient representation ability and poses challenges in handling significant target appearance changes. To address this problem, we propose a prototype-based cross-modal object tracker called ProtoTrack, which introduces a novel prototype learning scheme to adapt to significant target appearance variations, for cross-modal object tracking. In particular, we design a multi-modal prototype to represent target information by multi-kind samples, including a fixed sample from the first frame and two representative samples from different modalities. Moreover, we develop a prototype generation algorithm based on two new modules to ensure the prototype representative in different challenges......

While incorporating additional modalities like depth and infrared data has proven effective, existing multi-modal imaging platforms are complex and lack real-world applicability. In contrast, near-infrared (NIR) imaging, commonly used in surveillance cameras, can switch between RGB and NIR based on light intensity. However, tracking objects across these heterogeneous modalities poses significant challenges, particularly due to the absence of modality switch signals during tracking. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive cross-modal object tracking algorithm called Modality-Aware Fusion Network (MAFNet). MAFNet efficiently integrates information from both RGB and NIR modalities using an adaptive weighting mechanism, effectively bridging the appearance gap and enabling a modality-aware target representation. It consists of two key components: an adaptive weighting module and a modality-specific representation module......

Furthermore, we introduce MSDeAOT, a variant of the AOT series that incorporates transformers at multiple feature scales. MSDeAOT efficiently propagates object masks from previous frames to the current frame using two feature scales of 16 and 8.

To address this, we introduce EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification (HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement, or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations. Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness across challenging surgical conditions.

However, the demand for computationally complex tasks has increased faster than advances in battery technology. This opens up possibilities for improvements using edge computing. In edge computing, edge servers can achieve lower latency responses compared to traditional cloud servers through strategic geographic deployments. Furthermore, these servers can maintain superior computational performance compared to UAVs, as they are not limited by battery constraints. Combining these technologies by aiding UAVs with edge servers, research finds measurable improvements in task completion speed, energy efficiency, and reliability across multiple applications and industries. This systematic literature review aims to analyze the current state of research and collect, select, and extract the key areas where UAV activities can be supported and improved through edge computing.

A promising solution is to predict contours using a deep learning model and then allow users to refine them. However, most existing methods focus on in-domain scenarios, limiting their effectiveness for cross-domain annotation tasks. In this paper, we propose SiamAnno, a framework inspired by the use of Siamese networks in object tracking. SiamAnno leverages one-shot learning to annotate previously unseen objects by taking a bounding box as input and predicting object boundaries, which can then be adjusted by annotators. Trained on one dataset and tested on another without fine-tuning, SiamAnno achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, demonstrating its ability to handle domain and environment shifts in cross-domain tasks. We also provide more comprehensive results compared to previous work, establishing a strong baseline for future research. To our knowledge, SiamAnno is the first model to explore Siamese architecture for instance annotation.

The prevailing hyperspectral methods adapt pretrained RGB-based object tracking networks for hyperspectral tasks by fine-tuning the entire network on hyperspectral datasets, which achieves impressive results in challenging scenarios. However, the performance of hyperspectral trackers is limited by the loss of spectral information during the transformation, and fine-tuning the entire pretrained network is inefficient for practical applications. To address the issues, a new hyperspectral object tracking method, hyperspectral adapter for tracking (HyA-T), is proposed in this work. The hyperspectral adapter for the self-attention (HAS) and the hyperspectral adapter for the multilayer perceptron (HAM) are proposed to generate the adaption information and to transfer the multi-head self-attention (MSA) module and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in pretrained network for the hyperspectral object tracking task by augmenting the adaption information into the calculation of the MSA and MLP. Additionally, the hyperspectral enhancement of input (HEI) is proposed to augment the original spectral information into the input of the tracking network. The proposed methods extract spectral information directly from the hyperspectral images, which prevent the loss of the spectral information. Moreover, only the parameters in the proposed methods are fine-tuned, which is more efficient than the existing methods. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets with various spectral bands, verifing the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The HyA-T achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets.

Using transformers, which have consistently outperformed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in learning better feature representations, would be expected to be effective for Hyperspectral object tracking. However, training large transformers necessitates extensive datasets and prolonged training periods. This is particularly critical for complex tasks like object tracking, and the scarcity of large datasets in the hyperspectral domain acts as a bottleneck in achieving the full potential of powerful transformer models. This paper proposes an effective methodology that adapts large pretrained transformer-based foundation models for hyperspectral object tracking. We propose an adaptive, learnable spatial-spectral token fusion module that can be extended to any transformer-based backbone for learning inherent spatial-spectral features in hyperspectral data. Furthermore, our model incorporates a cross-modality training pipeline that facilitates effective learning across hyperspectral datasets collected with different sensor modalities. This enables the extraction of complementary knowledge from additional modalities, whether or not they are present during testing. Our proposed model also achieves superior performance with minimal training iterations.

Depending on the input modility, tracking tasks can be divided into RGB tracking and RGB+X (e.g. RGB+N, and RGB+D) tracking. Despite the different input modalities, the core aspect of tracking is the temporal matching. Based on this common ground, we present a general framework to unify various tracking tasks, termed as OneTracker. OneTracker first performs a large-scale pre-training on a RGB tracker called Foundation Tracker. This pretraining phase equips the Foundation Tracker with a stable ability to estimate the location of the target object. Then we regard other modality information as prompt and build Prompt Tracker upon Foundation Tracker. Through freezing the Foundation Tracker and only adjusting some additional trainable parameters, Prompt Tracker inhibits the strong localization ability from Foundation Tracker and achieves parameter-efficient finetuning on downstream RGB+X tracking tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our general framework OneTracker, which is consisted of Foundation Tracker and Prompt Tracker, we conduct extensive experiments on 6 popular tracking tasks across 11 benchmarks and our OneTracker outperforms other models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In this work, we propose InstFormer, a carefully designed framework for the OpenVIS task that achieves powerful open-vocabulary capabilities through lightweight fine-tuning with limited-category data. InstFormer begins with the open-world mask proposal network, encouraged to propose all potential instance class-agnostic masks by the contrastive instance margin loss. Next, we introduce InstCLIP, adapted from pre-trained CLIP with Instance Guidance Attention, which encodes open-vocabulary instance tokens efficiently. These instance tokens not only enable open-vocabulary classification but also offer strong universal tracking capabilities. Furthermore, to prevent the tracking module from being constrained by the training data with limited categories, we propose the universal rollout association, which transforms the tracking problem into predicting the next frame's instance tracking token. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed InstFormer achieve state-of-the-art capabilities on a comprehensive OpenVIS evaluation benchmark, while also achieves competitive performance in fully supervised VIS task.

Our analysis shows that multiple player, referee and ball tracking in soccer videos is far from being solved, with several improvement required in case of fast motion or in scenarios of severe occlusion.

We address OVQ2D with ESOM (Egocentric Streaming Object Memory), a novel framework integrating an object discovery module, an object tracking module, and a memory module that find, track, and store spatio-temporal object information for efficient querying. Experiments on Ego4D demonstrate ESOM's superiority over other online approaches, though OVQ2D remains challenging, with top performance at only ~4% success. ESOM's accuracy increases markedly with perfect object tracking (31.91%), discovery (40.55%), or both (81.92%), underscoring the need of applied research on these components.

However, their practicality is limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module, which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark, outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed. The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT.

This imbalance in modality dependence limits the ability of methods to dynamically utilize complementary information from each modality in complex scenarios, making it challenging to fully perceive the advantages of multi-modal. As a result, a unified parameter model often underperforms in various multi-modal tracking tasks. To address this issue, we propose APTrack, a novel unified tracker designed for multi-modal adaptive perception. Unlike previous methods, APTrack explores a unified representation through an equal modeling strategy. This strategy allows the model to dynamically adapt to various modalities and tasks without requiring additional fine-tuning between different tasks. Moreover, our tracker integrates an adaptive modality interaction (AMI) module that efficiently bridges cross-modality interactions by generating learnable tokens. Experiments conducted on five diverse multi-modal datasets (RGBT234, LasHeR, VisEvent, DepthTrack, and VOT-RGBD2022) demonstrate that APTrack not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art unified multi-modal trackers but also outperforms trackers designed for specific multi-modal tasks.

It consolidates five SOT tasks (RGB-based, RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, RGB-Event, RGB-Language Tracking) into a unified model trained in a single session. Due to the distinct nature of the data, current methods typically design individual architectures and train separate models for each task. This fragmentation results in redundant training processes, repetitive technological innovations, and limited cross-modal knowledge sharing. In contrast, SUTrack demonstrates that a single model with a unified input representation can effectively handle various common SOT tasks, eliminating the need for task-specific designs and separate training sessions. Additionally, we introduce a task-recognition auxiliary training strategy and a soft token type embedding to further enhance SUTrack's performance with minimal overhead. Experiments show that SUTrack outperforms previous task-specific counterparts across 11 datasets spanning five SOT tasks. Moreover, we provide a range of models catering edge devices as well as high-performance GPUs, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. We hope SUTrack could serve as a strong foundation for further compelling research into unified tracking models. Code and models are available at github.com/chenxin-dlut/SUTrack.

Furthermore, the fixed-window memory approach in the original model does not consider the quality of memories selected to condition the image features for the next frame, leading to error propagation in videos. This paper introduces SAMURAI, an enhanced adaptation of SAM 2 specifically designed for visual object tracking. By incorporating temporal motion cues with the proposed motion-aware memory selection mechanism, SAMURAI effectively predicts object motion and refines mask selection, achieving robust, accurate tracking without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. SAMURAI operates in real-time and demonstrates strong zero-shot performance across diverse benchmark datasets, showcasing its ability to generalize without fine-tuning. In evaluations, SAMURAI achieves significant improvements in success rate and precision over existing trackers, with a 7.1% AUC gain on LaSOT$_{\text{ext}}$ and a 3.5% AO gain on GOT-10k. Moreover, it achieves competitive results compared to fully supervised methods on LaSOT, underscoring its robustness in complex tracking scenarios and its potential for real-world applications in dynamic environments.

TAP leverages the zero-shot detection capabilities of vision-language foundation models like Grounding DINO to automatically generate pseudo-labels for sweet peppers in video sequences with minimal human intervention. These pseudo-labels, refined when necessary, are used to train a YOLOv8 segmentation network. To enhance detection accuracy under challenging conditions, we incorporate pre-processing techniques such as relighting adjustments and apply depth-based filtering during post-inference. For object tracking, we integrate the Matching by Segment Anything (MASA) adapter with the BoT-SORT algorithm. Our approach achieves a HOTA score of 80.4%, MOTA of 66.1%, Recall of 74.0%, and Precision of 90.7%, demonstrating effective tracking of sweet peppers without extensive manual effort.

Existing solutions for efficient tracking mainly focus on adopting light-weight backbones or modules, which nevertheless come at the cost of a sacrifice in precision. In this paper, inspired by dynamic network routing, we propose DyTrack, a dynamic transformer framework for efficient tracking. Real-world tracking scenarios exhibit diverse levels of complexity. We argue that a simple network is sufficient for easy frames in video sequences, while more computation could be assigned to difficult ones. DyTrack automatically learns to configure proper reasoning routes for various inputs, gaining better utilization of the available computational budget. Thus, it can achieve higher performance with the same running speed. We formulate instance-specific tracking as a sequential decision problem and attach terminating branches to intermediate layers of the entire model. Especially, to fully utilize the computations, we introduce the feature recycling mechanism to reuse the outputs of predecessors. Furthermore, a target-aware self-distillation strategy is designed to enhance the discriminating capabilities of early predictions by effectively mimicking the representation pattern of the deep model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DyTrack achieves promising speed-precision trade-offs with only a single model. For instance, DyTrack obtains 64.9% AUC on LaSOT with a speed of 256 fps.

This paper explores the possibilities of replacing the Kalman filter with a learning-based motion model that effectively enhances tracking accuracy and adaptability beyond the constraints of Kalman filter-based tracker. In this paper, our proposed method MambaMOT and MambaMOT+, demonstrate advanced performance on challenging MOT datasets such as DanceTrack and SportsMOT, showcasing their ability to handle intricate, non-linear motion patterns and frequent occlusions more effectively than traditional methods.

This involves aligning features obtained from diverse sources to enable more efficient training with larger datasets and constraints, as well as leveraging the wealth of information contained in each modality. 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) are two critical perceptual tasks in computer vision, which have numerous downstream applications, such as Action Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Yet, there are limited instances where the correlation between Image and 2D/3D human pose has been clearly researched using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPE, a unified Human Pose Estimation pipeline, which aligns features from all three modalities, i.e., 2D human pose estimation, lifting-based and image-based 3D human pose estimation, in the same pipeline. To align more than two modalities at the same time, we propose a novel singular value based contrastive learning loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts the performance. In our evaluation, UniHPE achieves remarkable performance metrics: MPJPE $50.5$mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PAMPJPE $51.6$mm on the 3DPW dataset. Our proposed method holds immense potential to advance the field of computer vision and contribute to various applications.

More specifically, short-term re-identification (ReID) is difficult due to the nature of the characteristics of small targets and the sudden movement of the drone's gimbal. Long-term ReID suffers from the lack of useful appearance diversity. In response to these challenges, we present an adaptable motion-based MOT algorithm, called Metadata Guided MOT (MG-MOT). This algorithm effectively merges short-term tracking data into coherent long-term tracks, harnessing crucial metadata from UAVs, including GPS position, drone altitude, and camera orientations. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our MOT algorithm. Utilizing the challenging SeaDroneSee tracking dataset, which encompasses the aforementioned scenarios, we achieve a much-improved performance in the latest edition of the UAV-based Maritime Object Tracking Challenge with a state-of-the-art HOTA of 69.5% and an IDF1 of 85.9% on the testing split.

This poses a substantial challenge in orchestrating computation and communication resources to provide fresh status information. In this paper, we consider a scenario where multiple energy-constrained devices served by an edge server. To extract status information, each device can either do the computation locally or offload it to the edge server. A scheduling policy is needed to determine when and where to compute for each device, taking into account communication and computation capabilities, as well as task-specific timeliness requirements. To that end, we first model the timeliness requirements as general penalty functions of Age of Information (AoI). A convex optimization problem is formulated to provide a lower bound of the minimum AoI penalty given system parameters. Using KKT conditions, we proposed a novel scheduling policy which evaluates status update priorities based on communication and computation delays and task-specific timeliness requirements. The proposed policy is applied to an object tracking application and carried out on a large video dataset. Simulation results show that our policy improves tracking accuracy compared with scheduling policies based on video content information.

Previous works focus on designing effective architectures suited for tracking, but ignore that data augmentation is equally crucial for training a well-performing model. In this paper, we first explore the impact of general data augmentations on transformer-based trackers via systematic experiments, and reveal the limited effectiveness of these common strategies. Motivated by experimental observations, we then propose two data augmentation methods customized for tracking. First, we optimize existing random cropping via a dynamic search radius mechanism and simulation for boundary samples. Second, we propose a token-level feature mixing augmentation strategy, which enables the model against challenges like background interference. Extensive experiments on two transformer-based trackers and six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and data efficiency of our methods, especially under challenging settings, like one-shot tracking and small image resolutions.

However, existing trackers are hampered by low speed, limiting their applicability on devices with limited computational power. To alleviate this problem, we propose HiT, a new family of efficient tracking models that can run at high speed on different devices while retaining high performance. The central idea of HiT is the Bridge Module, which bridges the gap between modern lightweight transformers and the tracking framework. The Bridge Module incorporates the high-level information of deep features into the shallow large-resolution features. In this way, it produces better features for the tracking head. We also propose a novel dual-image position encoding technique that simultaneously encodes the position information of both the search region and template images. The HiT model achieves promising speed with competitive performance. For instance, it runs at 61 frames per second (fps) on the Nvidia Jetson AGX edge device. Furthermore, HiT attains 64.6% AUC on the LaSOT benchmark, surpassing all previous efficient trackers.

While MOTRv2 partly addresses this problem, it demands an additional detection network for assistance. In this work, we serve as the first to reveal that this conflict arises from the unfair label assignment between detect queries and track queries during training, where these detect queries recognize targets and track queries associate them. Based on this observation, we propose MOTRv3, which balances the label assignment process using the developed release-fetch supervision strategy. In this strategy, labels are first released for detection and gradually fetched back for association. Besides, another two strategies named pseudo label distillation and track group denoising are designed to further improve the supervision for detection and association. Without the assistance of an extra detection network during inference, MOTRv3 achieves impressive performance across diverse benchmarks, e.g., MOT17, DanceTrack.

Information gathered could be used to release unwanted bycatch in real-time. However, traditional multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have limitations, as they are developed for tracking vehicles or pedestrians with linear motions and diverse appearances, which are different from the scenarios such as livestock monitoring. Therefore, we propose a novel MOT method, built upon an existing observation-centric tracking algorithm, by adopting a new iterative association step to significantly boost the performance of tracking targets with a uniform appearance. The iterative association module is designed as an extendable component that can be merged into most existing tracking methods. Our method offers improved performance in tracking targets with uniform appearance and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on our underwater fish datasets as well as the MOT17 dataset, without increasing latency nor sacrificing accuracy as measured by HOTA, MOTA, and IDF1 performance metrics.

While this manner obtains promising tracking efficiency, a fixed-size search region lacks flexibility and is likely to fail in some cases, e.g., fast motion and distractor interference. Trackers tend to lose the target object due to the limited search region or experience interference from distractors due to the excessive search region. Drawing inspiration from the pattern humans track an object, we propose a novel tracking paradigm, called Search Region Regulation Tracking (SRRT) that applies a small eyereach when the target is captured and zooms out the search field when the target is about to be lost. SRRT applies a proposed search region regulator to estimate an optimal search region dynamically for each frame, by which the tracker can flexibly respond to transient changes in the location of object occurrences. To adapt the object's appearance variation during online tracking, we further propose a lockingstate determined updating strategy for reference frame updating. The proposed SRRT is concise without bells and whistles, yet achieves evident improvements and competitive results with other state-of-the-art trackers on eight benchmarks. On the large-scale LaSOT benchmark, SRRT improves SiamRPN++ and TransT with absolute gains of 4.6% and 3.1% in terms of AUC. The code and models will be released.

This paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally, MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection, modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation. Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities, laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth (D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT), covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets, revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal categories when compared with RGB datasets.

Existing trackers often depend on cropped template regions and have limited motion modeling capabilities, which pose challenges when dealing with tiny targets. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective infrared tiny-object tracker that enhances tracking performance by integrating global detection and motion-aware learning with temporal priors. Our method is based on object detection and achieves significant improvements through two key innovations. First, we introduce frame dynamics, leveraging frame difference and optical flow to encode both prior target features and motion characteristics at the input level, enabling the model to better distinguish the target from background clutter. Second, we propose a trajectory constraint filtering strategy in the post-processing stage, utilizing spatio-temporal priors to suppress false positives and enhance tracking robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches across multiple metrics in challenging infrared UAV tracking scenarios. Notably, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in the 4th Anti-UAV Challenge, securing 1st place in Track 1 and 2nd place in Track 2.

Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT. Code will be released.

However, it is important to note that AD visual perception encompasses more than just object detection; it also includes Multiple Object Tracking (MOT). MOT enhances the robustness by compensating for object detection errors and requiring consistent object detection results across multiple frames before influencing tracking results and driving decisions. Thus, MOT makes attacks on object detection alone less effective. To attack such robust AD visual perception, a digital hijacking attack has been proposed to cause dangerous driving scenarios. However, this attack has limited effectiveness.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel physical-world adversarial patch attack, ControlLoc, designed to exploit hijacking vulnerabilities in entire AD visual perception. ControlLoc utilizes a two-stage process: initially identifying the optimal location for the adversarial patch, and subsequently generating the patch that can modify the perceived location and shape of objects with the optimal location. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of ControlLoc, achieving an impressive average attack success rate of around 98.1% across various AD visual perceptions and datasets, which is four times greater effectiveness than the existing hijacking attack. The effectiveness of ControlLoc is further validated in physical-world conditions, including real vehicle tests under different conditions such as outdoor light conditions with an average attack success rate of 77.5%. AD system-level impact assessments are also included, such as vehicle collision, using industry-grade AD systems and production-grade AD simulators with an average vehicle collision rate and unnecessary emergency stop rate of 81.3%.

However, high latency in these visual perception components can lead to significant safety risks, such as vehicle collisions. While previous research has extensively explored latency attacks within the digital realm, translating these methods effectively to the physical world presents challenges. For instance, existing attacks rely on perturbations that are unrealistic or impractical for AD, such as adversarial perturbations affecting areas like the sky, or requiring large patches that obscure most of a camera's view, thus making them impossible to be conducted effectively in the real world.
  In this paper, we introduce SlowPerception, the first physical-world latency attack against AD perception, via generating projector-based universal perturbations. SlowPerception strategically creates numerous phantom objects on various surfaces in the environment, significantly increasing the computational load of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and MOT, thereby inducing substantial latency. Our SlowPerception achieves second-level latency in physical-world settings, with an average latency of 2.5 seconds across different AD perception systems, scenarios, and hardware configurations. This performance significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art latency attacks. Additionally, we conduct AD system-level impact assessments, such as vehicle collisions, using industry-grade AD systems with production-grade AD simulators with a 97% average rate. We hope that our analyses can inspire further research in this critical domain, enhancing the robustness of AD systems against emerging vulnerabilities.

Existing works usually learn a discriminative feature representation, such as motion and appearance, to associate the detections across frames, which are easily affected by mutual occlusion and background clutter in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage feature learning paradigm to jointly learn single-shot and multi-shot features for different targets, so as to achieve robust data association in the tracking process. For the detections without being associated, we design a novel single-shot feature learning module to extract discriminative features of each detection, which can efficiently associate targets between adjacent frames. For the tracklets being lost several frames, we design a novel multi-shot feature learning module to extract discriminative features of each tracklet, which can accurately refind these lost targets after a long period. Once equipped with a simple data association logic, the resulting VisualTracker can perform robust MOT based on the single-shot and multi-shot feature representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved significant improvements on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets while reaching state-of-the-art performance on DanceTrack dataset.

Existing methods often employ extracted embeddings to re-establish associations between new detections and previously disrupted tracks. However, the reliability of embeddings diminishes when the region of the occluded object frequently contains adjacent objects or clutters, especially in scenarios with severe occlusion. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel multiple object tracking method based on visual embedding consistency, mainly including: 1) Occlusion Prediction Module (OPM) and 2) Occlusion-Aware Association Module (OAAM). The OPM predicts occlusion information for each true detection, facilitating the selection of valid samples for consistency learning of the track's visual embedding. The OAAM leverages occlusion cues and visual embeddings to generate two separate embeddings for each track, guaranteeing consistency in both unoccluded and occluded detections. By integrating these two modules, our method is capable of addressing track interruptions caused by occlusion in online tracking scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance levels in both unoccluded and occluded tracking scenarios.

Despite the significant progress made in MOT, pedestrian attributes, such as gender, hairstyle, body shape, and clothing features, which contain rich and high-level information, have been less explored. To address this gap, we propose a simple, effective, and generic method to predict pedestrian attributes to support general Re-ID embedding. We first introduce AttMOT, a large, highly enriched synthetic dataset for pedestrian tracking, containing over 80k frames and 6 million pedestrian IDs with different time, weather conditions, and scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, AttMOT is the first MOT dataset with semantic attributes. Subsequently, we explore different approaches to fuse Re-ID embedding and pedestrian attributes, including attention mechanisms, which we hope will stimulate the development of attribute-assisted MOT. The proposed method AAM demonstrates its effectiveness and generality on several representative pedestrian multi-object tracking benchmarks, including MOT17 and MOT20, through experiments on the AttMOT dataset. When applied to state-of-the-art trackers, AAM achieves consistent improvements in MOTA, HOTA, AssA, IDs, and IDF1 scores. For instance, on MOT17, the proposed method yields a +1.1 MOTA, +1.7 HOTA, and +1.8 IDF1 improvement when used with FairMOT. To encourage further research on attribute-assisted MOT, we will release the AttMOT dataset.

Existing methods often learn reliable motion patterns to match the same target between adjacent frames and discriminative appearance features to re-identify the lost targets after a long period. However, the reliability of motion prediction and the discriminability of appearances can be easily hurt by dense crowds and extreme occlusions in the tracking process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective multi-object tracker, i.e., MotionTrack, which learns robust short-term and long-term motions in a unified framework to associate trajectories from a short to long range. For dense crowds, we design a novel Interaction Module to learn interaction-aware motions from short-term trajectories, which can estimate the complex movement of each target. For extreme occlusions, we build a novel Refind Module to learn reliable long-term motions from the target's history trajectory, which can link the interrupted trajectory with its corresponding detection. Our Interaction Module and Refind Module are embedded in the well-known tracking-by-detection paradigm, which can work in tandem to maintain superior performance. Extensive experimental results on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in challenging scenarios, and it achieves state-of-the-art performances at various MOT metrics.

Addressing this, we introduce PlanarTrack, a large-scale challenging planar tracking benchmark. Specifically, PlanarTrack consists of 1,000 videos with more than 490K images. All these videos are collected in complex unconstrained scenarios from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack, compared with existing benchmarks, more challenging but realistic for real-world applications. To ensure the high-quality annotation, each frame in PlanarTrack is manually labeled using four corners with multiple-round careful inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack, to date, is the largest and most challenging dataset dedicated to planar object tracking. In order to analyze the proposed PlanarTrack, we evaluate 10 planar trackers and conduct comprehensive comparisons and in-depth analysis. Our results, not surprisingly, demonstrate that current top-performing planar trackers degenerate significantly on the challenging PlanarTrack and more efforts are needed to improve planar tracking in the future. In addition, we further derive a variant named PlanarTrack$_{\mathbf{BB}}$ for generic object tracking from PlanarTrack. Our evaluation of 10 excellent generic trackers on PlanarTrack$_{\mathrm{BB}}$ manifests that, surprisingly, PlanarTrack$_{\mathrm{BB}}$ is even more challenging than several popular generic tracking benchmarks and more attention should be paid to handle such planar objects, though they are rigid. All benchmarks and evaluations will be released at the project webpage.

Despite recent progress, the intrinsic relationship between the two subtasks of tracking and referring in RMOT has not been fully studied. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of their interdependence, revealing that current two-stage Referring-by-Tracking (RBT) frameworks remain fundamentally limited by insufficient modeling of subtask interactions and inflexible reliance on semantic alignment modules like CLIP. To this end, we propose JustHook, a novel two-stage RBT framework where a Hook module is firstly designed to redefine the linkage between subtasks. The Hook is built centered on grid sampling at the feature-level and is used for context-aware target feature extraction. Moreover, we propose a Parallel Combined Decoder (PCD) that learns in a unified joint feature space rather than relying on pre-defined cross-modal embeddings. Our design not only enhances the interpretability and modularity but also significantly improves the generalization. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI, Refer-KITTI-V2, and Refer-Dance demonstrate that JustHook achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the HOTA by +6.9\% on Refer-KITTI-V2 with superior efficiency.

However, training these trackers in heterogeneous scenarios poses significant challenges, including negative interference - where the model learns conflicting scene-specific parameters - and limited domain generalization, which often necessitates expensive fine-tuning to adapt the models to new domains. In response to these challenges, we introduce Parameter-efficient Scenario-specific Tracking Architecture (PASTA), a novel framework that combines Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Modular Deep Learning (MDL). Specifically, we define key scenario attributes (e.g, camera-viewpoint, lighting condition) and train specialized PEFT modules for each attribute. These expert modules are combined in parameter space, enabling systematic generalization to new domains without increasing inference time. Extensive experiments on MOTSynth, along with zero-shot evaluations on MOT17 and PersonPath22 demonstrate that a neural tracker built from carefully selected modules surpasses its monolithic counterpart.

In view of this, we aim at extending tracking-by-detection to multi-modal settings, where a comprehensive cost has to be computed from heterogeneous information e.g., 2D motion cues, visual appearance, and pose estimates. More precisely, we follow a case study where a rough estimate of 3D information is also available and must be merged with other traditional metrics (e.g., the IoU). To achieve that, recent approaches resort to either simple rules or complex heuristics to balance the contribution of each cost. However, i) they require careful tuning of tailored hyperparameters on a hold-out set, and ii) they imply these costs to be independent, which does not hold in reality. We address these issues by building upon an elegant probabilistic formulation, which considers the cost of a candidate association as the negative log-likelihood yielded by a deep density estimator, trained to model the conditional joint probability distribution of correct associations. Our experiments, conducted on both simulated and real benchmarks, show that our approach consistently enhances the performance of several tracking-by-detection algorithms.

However, in 3D space, data association is not so hard. Only with a 3D Kalman Filter, the online object tracker can associate the detections from LiDAR. In this paper, we rethink the data association in 2D MOT and utilize the 3D object representation to separate each object in the feature space. Unlike the existing depth-based MOT methods, the 3D object representation can be jointly learned with the object association module. Besides, the object's 3D representation is learned from the video and supervised by the 2D tracking labels without additional manual annotations from LiDAR or pretrained depth estimator. With 3D object representation learning from Pseudo 3D object labels in monocular videos, we propose a new 2D MOT paradigm, called P3DTrack. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset.

Yet existing MOT benchmarks cast little attention on the domain, limiting its development. In this work, we present a new large-scale multi-object tracking dataset in diverse sports scenes, coined as \emph{SportsMOT}, where all players on the court are supposed to be tracked. It consists of 240 video sequences, over 150K frames (almost 15\times MOT17) and over 1.6M bounding boxes (3\times MOT17) collected from 3 sports categories, including basketball, volleyball and football. Our dataset is characterized with two key properties: 1) fast and variable-speed motion and 2) similar yet distinguishable appearance. We expect SportsMOT to encourage the MOT trackers to promote in both motion-based association and appearance-based association. We benchmark several state-of-the-art trackers and reveal the key challenge of SportsMOT lies in object association. To alleviate the issue, we further propose a new multi-object tracking framework, termed as \emph{MixSort}, introducing a MixFormer-like structure as an auxiliary association model to prevailing tracking-by-detection trackers. By integrating the customized appearance-based association with the original motion-based association, MixSort achieves state-of-the-art performance on SportsMOT and MOT17. Based on MixSort, we give an in-depth analysis and provide some profound insights into SportsMOT. The dataset and code will be available at https://deeperaction.github.io/datasets/sportsmot.html.

However, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive multi-view datasets and effective cross-view integration methods. To overcome these limitations, we compiled a Multi-View object Tracking (MVTrack) dataset of 234K high-quality annotated frames featuring 27 distinct objects across various scenes. In conjunction with this dataset, we introduce a novel MVOT method, Multi-View Integration Tracker (MITracker), to efficiently integrate multi-view object features and provide stable tracking outcomes. MITracker can track any object in video frames of arbitrary length from arbitrary viewpoints. The key advancements of our method over traditional single-view approaches come from two aspects: (1) MITracker transforms 2D image features into a 3D feature volume and compresses it into a bird's eye view (BEV) plane, facilitating inter-view information fusion; (2) we propose an attention mechanism that leverages geometric information from fused 3D feature volume to refine the tracking results at each view. MITracker outperforms existing methods on the MVTrack and GMTD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

A critical challenge is accurately identifying and tracking sounding objects related to the question along the timeline. In this paper, we present a new Patch-level Sounding Object Tracking (PSOT) method. It begins with a Motion-driven Key Patch Tracking (M-KPT) module, which relies on visual motion information to identify salient visual patches with significant movements that are more likely to relate to sounding objects and questions. We measure the patch-wise motion intensity map between neighboring video frames and utilize it to construct and guide a motion-driven graph network. Meanwhile, we design a Sound-driven KPT (S-KPT) module to explicitly track sounding patches. This module also involves a graph network, with the adjacency matrix regularized by the audio-visual correspondence map. The M-KPT and S-KPT modules are performed in parallel for each temporal segment, allowing balanced tracking of salient and sounding objects. Based on the tracked patches, we further propose a Question-driven KPT (Q-KPT) module to retain patches highly relevant to the question, ensuring the model focuses on the most informative clues. The audio-visual-question features are updated during the processing of these modules, which are then aggregated for final answer prediction. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive performance even compared to recent large-scale pretraining-based approaches.

Traditional strategies, such as aggregating region proposals, often suffer from feature variance due to the inclusion of background information. We introduce a novel instance mask-based feature aggregation approach, significantly refining this process and deepening the understanding of object dynamics across video frames. We present FAIM, a new VOD method that enhances temporal Feature Aggregation by leveraging Instance Mask features. In particular, we propose the lightweight Instance Feature Extraction Module (IFEM) to learn instance mask features and the Temporal Instance Classification Aggregation Module (TICAM) to aggregate instance mask and classification features across video frames. Using YOLOX as a base detector, FAIM achieves 87.9% mAP on the ImageNet VID dataset at 33 FPS on a single 2080Ti GPU, setting a new benchmark for the speed-accuracy trade-off. Additional experiments on multiple datasets validate that our approach is robust, method-agnostic, and effective in multi-object tracking, demonstrating its broader applicability to video understanding tasks.

However, UWB signal can be affected by signal reflections and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions between anchors; hence, in a broader sense, the specific geometry of the environment and the disposition of obstructing elements in the map may drastically hinder the reliability of UWB for precise robot localization. This work aims to mitigate this problem by learning a map-specific characterization of the UWB quality signal with a fingerprint semi-supervised novelty detection methodology. An unsupervised autoencoder neural network is trained on nominal UWB map conditions, and then it is used to predict errors derived from the introduction of perturbing novelties in the environment. This work poses a step change in the understanding of UWB localization and its reliability in evolving environmental conditions. The resulting performance of the proposed method is proved by fine-grained experiments obtained with a visual tracking ground truth.

One such situation is the semantic segmentation of point clouds. In this context, existing methods employ contrastive learning strategies and define positive pairs by performing various augmentation of point clusters in a single frame. As such, these methods do not exploit the temporal nature of LiDAR data. In this paper, we introduce an SSL strategy that leverages positive pairs in both the spatial and temporal domain. To this end, we design (i) a point-to-cluster learning strategy that aggregates spatial information to distinguish objects; and (ii) a cluster-to-cluster learning strategy based on unsupervised object tracking that exploits temporal correspondences. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach via extensive experiments performed by self-supervised training on two large-scale LiDAR datasets and transferring the resulting models to other point cloud segmentation benchmarks. Our results evidence that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud SSL methods.

Indeed, it encouraged the study of novel robotics methods to successfully extract blocks from the tower. A Jenga game round undoubtedly embeds many traits of complex industrial or surgical manipulation tasks, requiring a multi-step strategy, the combination of visual and tactile data, and the highly precise motion of the robotic arm to perform a single block extraction. In this work, we propose a novel, cost-effective architecture for playing Jenga with e.Do, a 6-DOF anthropomorphic manipulator manufactured by Comau, a standard depth camera, and an inexpensive monodirectional force sensor. Our solution focuses on a visual-based control strategy to accurately align the end-effector with the desired block, enabling block extraction by pushing. To this aim, we train an instance segmentation deep learning model on a synthetic custom dataset to segment each piece of the Jenga tower, allowing visual tracking of the desired block's pose during the motion of the manipulator. We integrate the visual-based strategy with a 1D force sensor to detect whether the block can be safely removed by identifying a force threshold value. Our experimentation shows that our low-cost solution allows e.DO to precisely reach removable blocks and perform up to 14 consecutive extractions in a row.

However, existing RMOT approaches often treat language descriptions as holistic embeddings and struggle to effectively integrate the rich semantic information contained in language expressions with visual features. This limitation is especially apparent in complex scenes requiring comprehensive understanding of both static object attributes and spatial motion information. In this paper, we propose a Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CDRMT) framework that addresses these challenges. It adapts the "what" and "where" pathways from the human visual processing system to RMOT tasks. Specifically, our framework first establishes cross-modal connections while preserving modality-specific characteristics. It then disentangles language descriptions and hierarchically injects them into object queries, refining object understanding from coarse to fine-grained semantic levels. Finally, we reconstruct language representations based on visual features, ensuring that tracked objects faithfully reflect the referring expression. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDRMT achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 6.0% in HOTA score on Refer-KITTI and 3.2% on Refer-KITTI-V2. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art in RMOT while simultaneously providing new insights into multi-source information fusion.

The VOT technology could be applied in various scenarios, processing data of diverse modalities such as RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud. Besides, since no one sensor could handle all the dynamic and varying environments, multi-modal VOT is also investigated. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent progress of both single-modal and multi-modal VOT, especially the deep learning methods. Specifically, we first review three types of mainstream single-modal VOT, including RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud tracking. In particular, we conclude four widely-used single-modal frameworks, abstracting their schemas and categorizing the existing inheritors. Then we summarize four kinds of multi-modal VOT, including RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, RGB-LiDAR and RGB-Language. Moreover, the comparison results in plenty of VOT benchmarks of the discussed modalities are presented. Finally, we provide recommendations and insightful observations, inspiring the future development of this fast-growing literature.

Most existing approaches train and track within a single domain, resulting in a lack of cross-domain generalizability to data from other domains. While several works have introduced natural language representation to bridge the domain gap in visual tracking, these textual descriptions often provide too high-level a view and fail to distinguish various instances within the same class. In this paper, we address this limitation by developing IP-MOT, an end-to-end transformer model for MOT that operates without concrete textual descriptions. Our approach is underpinned by two key innovations: Firstly, leveraging a pre-trained vision-language model, we obtain instance-level pseudo textual descriptions via prompt-tuning, which are invariant across different tracking scenes; Secondly, we introduce a query-balanced strategy, augmented by knowledge distillation, to further boost the generalization capabilities of our model. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used MOT benchmarks, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack, demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance on same-domain data compared to state-of-the-art models but also significantly improves the performance of query-based trackers by large margins for cross-domain inputs.

This paper proposes a Tracklet Graph and Query Graph-based framework, i.e., GSLAMOT, to address this challenge. GSLAMOT utilizes camera and LiDAR multimodal information as inputs and divides the representation of the dynamic scene into a semantic map for representing the static environment, a trajectory of the ego-agent, and an online maintained Tracklet Graph (TG) for tracking and predicting the 3D poses of the detected mobile objects. A Query Graph (QG) is constructed in each frame by object detection to query and update TG. For accurate object association, a Multi-criteria Star Graph Association (MSGA) method is proposed to find matched objects between the detections in QG and the predicted tracklets in TG. Then, an Object-centric Graph Optimization (OGO) method is proposed to simultaneously optimize the TG, the semantic map, and the agent trajectory. It triangulates the detected objects into the map to enrich the map's semantic information. We address the efficiency issues to handle the three tightly coupled tasks in parallel. Experiments are conducted on KITTI, Waymo, and an emulated Traffic Congestion dataset that highlights challenging scenarios. Experiments show that GSLAMOT enables accurate crowded object tracking while conducting SLAM accurately in challenging scenarios, demonstrating more excellent performances than the state-of-the-art methods.

However, the effectiveness of traditional MOT methods is significantly reduced when it comes to dynamic platforms like drones. This decrease is attributed to the distinctive challenges in the MOT-on-drone scenario: (1) objects are generally small in the image plane, blurred, and frequently occluded, making them challenging to detect and recognize; (2) drones move and see objects from different angles, causing the unreliability of the predicted positions and feature embeddings of the objects. This paper proposes DroneMOT, which firstly proposes a Dual-domain Integrated Attention (DIA) module that considers the fast movements of drones to enhance the drone-based object detection and feature embedding for small-sized, blurred, and occluded objects. Then, an innovative Motion-Driven Association (MDA) scheme is introduced, considering the concurrent movements of both the drone and the objects. Within MDA, an Adaptive Feature Synchronization (AFS) technique is presented to update the object features seen from different angles. Additionally, a Dual Motion-based Prediction (DMP) method is employed to forecast the object positions. Finally, both the refined feature embeddings and the predicted positions are integrated to enhance the object association. Comprehensive evaluations on VisDrone2019-MOT and UAVDT datasets show that DroneMOT provides substantial performance improvements over the state-of-the-art in the domain of MOT on drones.

To address these challenges, we present BronchoTrack, an innovative real-time framework for accurate branch-level localization, encompassing lumen detection, tracking, and airway association.To achieve real-time performance, we employ a benchmark lightweight detector for efficient lumen detection. We are the first to introduce multi-object tracking to bronchoscopic localization, mitigating temporal confusion in lumen identification caused by rapid bronchoscope movement and complex airway structures. To ensure generalization across patient cases, we propose a training-free detection-airway association method based on a semantic airway graph that encodes the hierarchy of bronchial tree structures.Experiments on nine patient datasets demonstrate BronchoTrack's localization accuracy of 85.64 \%, while accessing up to the 4th generation of airways.Furthermore, we tested BronchoTrack in an in-vivo animal study using a porcine model, where it successfully localized the bronchoscope into the 8th generation airway.Experimental evaluation underscores BronchoTrack's real-time performance in both satisfying accuracy and generalization, demonstrating its potential for clinical applications.

This paradigm relies heavily on an additional matching network to model the cross-correlation/similarity of the template and search region. In this paper, we forsake the conventional Siamese paradigm and propose a novel single-branch framework, SyncTrack, synchronizing the feature extracting and matching to avoid forwarding encoder twice for template and search region as well as introducing extra parameters of matching network. The synchronization mechanism is based on the dynamic affinity of the Transformer, and an in-depth analysis of the relevance is provided theoretically. Moreover, based on the synchronization, we introduce a novel Attentive Points-Sampling strategy into the Transformer layers (APST), replacing the random/Farthest Points Sampling (FPS) method with sampling under the supervision of attentive relations between the template and search region. It implies connecting point-wise sampling with the feature learning, beneficial to aggregating more distinctive and geometric features for tracking with sparse points. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (KITTI and NuScenes) show that SyncTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time tracking.

Recent MOT approaches can be categorized into two-stage tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods and one-stage joint detection and tracking (JDT) methods. Despite the success of these approaches, they also suffer from common problems, such as harmful global or local inconsistency, poor trade-off between robustness and model complexity, and lack of flexibility in different scenes within the same video. In this paper we propose a simple but robust framework that formulates object detection and association jointly as a consistent denoising diffusion process from paired noise boxes to paired ground-truth boxes. This novel progressive denoising diffusion strategy substantially augments the tracker's effectiveness, enabling it to discriminate between various objects. During the training stage, paired object boxes diffuse from paired ground-truth boxes to random distribution, and the model learns detection and tracking simultaneously by reversing this noising process. In inference, the model refines a set of paired randomly generated boxes to the detection and tracking results in a flexible one-step or multi-step denoising diffusion process. Extensive experiments on three widely used MOT benchmarks, including MOT17, MOT20, and Dancetrack, demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.

The central problem is how to learn a target-aware representation from the sparse and incomplete point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel Correlation Pyramid Network (CorpNet) with a unified encoder and a motion-factorized decoder. Specifically, the encoder introduces multi-level self attentions and cross attentions in its main branch to enrich the template and search region features and realize their fusion and interaction, respectively. Additionally, considering the sparsity characteristics of the point clouds, we design a lateral correlation pyramid structure for the encoder to keep as many points as possible by integrating hierarchical correlated features. The output features of the search region from the encoder can be directly fed into the decoder for predicting target locations without any extra matcher. Moreover, in the decoder of CorpNet, we design a motion-factorized head to explicitly learn the different movement patterns of the up axis and the x-y plane together. Extensive experiments on two commonly-used datasets show our CorpNet achieves state-of-the-art results while running in real-time.

First, it provides more accurate correlation and trustworthy matching in flow estimation by utilizing spatial self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms between adjacent frames to effectively capture global dependencies; Second, it recovers more compromised information (e.g., occlusion and motion blur) in flow estimation through long-range temporal association in dynamic scenes; Third, it enables a concise self-learning paradigm and effectively eliminate the complex and laborious multi-stage pre-training procedures. We achieve the state-of-the-art results on the Sintel, KITTI-15, as well as several downstream tasks, including video object detection, interpolation and stabilization. For its efficacy, we hope TransFlow could serve as a flexible baseline for optical flow estimation.

Image-feature regression methods heavily depend on matching results and do not utilize positional prior, while the autoregressive approach can only be trained using bounding boxes available in the training set, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance during testing with unseen data. Inspired by the diffusion model, denoising learning enhances the model's robustness to unseen data. Therefore, We introduce noise to bounding boxes, generating noisy boxes for training, thus enhancing model robustness on testing data. We propose a new paradigm to formulate the visual object tracking problem as a denoising learning process. However, tracking algorithms are usually asked to run in real-time, directly applying the diffusion model to object tracking would severely impair tracking speed. Therefore, we decompose the denoising learning process into every denoising block within a model, not by running the model multiple times, and thus we summarize the proposed paradigm as an in-model latent denoising learning process. Specifically, we propose a denoising Vision Transformer (ViT), which is composed of multiple denoising blocks. In the denoising block, template and search embeddings are projected into every denoising block as conditions. A denoising block is responsible for removing the noise in a predicted bounding box, and multiple stacked denoising blocks cooperate to accomplish the whole denoising process. Subsequently, we utilize image features and trajectory information to refine the denoised bounding box. Besides, we also utilize trajectory memory and visual memory to improve tracking stability. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive performance on several challenging datasets.

This intricate task involves reasoning on multi-modal data and precise target localization with temporal association. However, prior studies overlook the imbalanced data distribution between newborn targets and existing targets due to the nature of the task. In addition, they only indirectly fuse multi-modal features, struggling to deliver clear guidance on newborn target detection. To solve the above issues, we conduct a collaborative matching strategy to alleviate the impact of the imbalance, boosting the ability to detect newborn targets while maintaining tracking performance. In the encoder, we integrate and enhance the cross-modal and multi-scale fusion, overcoming the bottlenecks in previous work, where limited multi-modal information is shared and interacted between feature maps. In the decoder, we also develop a referring-infused adaptation that provides explicit referring guidance through the query tokens. The experiments showcase the superior performance of our model (+3.42%) compared to prior works, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

Despite significant progress made in this field, state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers often fail when faced with adversarial perturbations in the incoming frames. This can lead to significant robustness and security issues when these trackers are deployed in the real world. To achieve high accuracy on both clean and adversarial data, we propose building a spatial-temporal continuous representation using the semantic text guidance of the object of interest. This novel continuous representation enables us to reconstruct incoming frames to maintain semantic and appearance consistency with the object of interest and its clean counterparts. As a result, our proposed method successfully defends against different SOTA adversarial tracking attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean data. In particular, our method significantly increases tracking accuracy under adversarial attacks with around 90% relative improvement on UAV123, which is even higher than the accuracy on clean data.

Moving beyond traditional hand-crafted and data-driven feature learning methods, we incorporate spectral methods with deep learning, focusing on functional maps (FMs) and optimal transport (OT). Traditional OT-based approaches, often reliant on entropy regularization OT in learning-based framework, face computational challenges due to their quadratic cost. Our key contribution is to employ the sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) for OT, which is a valid fast optimal transport metric in an unsupervised shape matching framework. This unsupervised framework integrates functional map regularizers with a novel OT-based loss derived from SWD, enhancing feature alignment between shapes treated as discrete probability measures. We also introduce an adaptive refinement process utilizing entropy regularized OT, further refining feature alignments for accurate point-to-point correspondences. Our method demonstrates superior performance in non-rigid shape matching, including near-isometric and non-isometric scenarios, and excels in downstream tasks like segmentation transfer. The empirical results on diverse datasets highlight our framework's effectiveness and generalization capabilities, setting new standards in non-rigid shape matching with efficient OT metrics and an adaptive refinement module.

Prior works utilize all features from a fixed template or memory for visual object tracking. However, due to the dynamic nature of videos, the required reference historical information for different search regions at different time steps is also inconsistent. Therefore, using all features in the template and memory can lead to redundancy and impair tracking performance. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel tracking paradigm, consisting of a relevance attention mechanism and a global representation memory, which can adaptively assist the search region in selecting the most relevant historical information from reference features. Specifically, the proposed relevance attention mechanism in this work differs from previous approaches in that it can dynamically choose and build the optimal global representation memory for the current frame by accessing cross-frame information globally. Moreover, it can flexibly read the relevant historical information from the constructed memory to reduce redundancy and counteract the negative effects of harmful information. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving competitive performance on five challenging datasets with 71 FPS.

One potential reason is its label assignment strategy during training that consistently binds the tracked objects with tracking queries and then assigns the few newborns to detection queries. With one-to-one bipartite matching, such an assignment will yield unbalanced training, i.e., scarce positive samples for detection queries, especially for an enclosed scene, as the majority of the newborns come on stage at the beginning of videos. Thus, e2e-MOT will be easier to yield a tracking terminal without renewal or re-initialization, compared to other tracking-by-detection methods. To alleviate this problem, we present Co-MOT, a simple and effective method to facilitate e2e-MOT by a novel coopetition label assignment with a shadow concept. Specifically, we add tracked objects to the matching targets for detection queries when performing the label assignment for training the intermediate decoders. For query initialization, we expand each query by a set of shadow counterparts with limited disturbance to itself. With extensive ablations, Co-MOT achieves superior performance without extra costs, e.g., 69.4% HOTA on DanceTrack and 52.8% TETA on BDD100K. Impressively, Co-MOT only requires 38\% FLOPs of MOTRv2 to attain a similar performance, resulting in the 1.4$\times$ faster inference speed.

It involves detecting and associating objects with their respective identities across successive frames. Despite significant progress made in multiple object tracking (MOT), recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of existing MOT methods to adversarial attacks. Nevertheless, all of these attacks belong to digital attacks that inject pixel-level noise into input images, and are therefore ineffective in physical scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose PapMOT, which can generate physical adversarial patches against MOT for both digital and physical scenarios. Besides attacking the detection mechanism, PapMOT also optimizes a printable patch that can be detected as new targets to mislead the identity association process. Moreover, we introduce a patch enhancement strategy to further degrade the temporal consistency of tracking results across video frames, resulting in more aggressive attacks. We further develop new evaluation metrics to assess the robustness of MOT against such attacks. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our PapMOT can successfully attack various architectures of MOT trackers in digital scenarios. We also validate the effectiveness of PapMOT for physical attacks by deploying printed adversarial patches in the real world.

One critical issue is bridging the gap between discrete entities in low-level observations and the abstract concepts required for effective planning. A common solution is building hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language. However, language suffers from the inability to communicate detailed spatial information. We propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from past observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, supported by real-time object tracking from SAM-2. Our method unlocks the potential of VLMs, enabling them to tackle complex tasks that demand spatial reasoning. Experiments in Minecraft show that our approach enables agents to achieve previously unattainable tasks, with a $\mathbf{76}\%$ absolute improvement in open-world interaction performance.

Existing methods rely on frame-based detectors to locate interacting objects. However, this approach is subjected to heavy occlusions, background clutter, and distracting objects. To address the limitations, in this paper, we propose to leverage spatio-temporal information of hand-object interaction to track interactive objects under these challenging cases. Without prior knowledge of the general objects to be tracked like object tracking problems, we first utilize the spatial relation between hands and objects to adaptively discover the interacting objects from the scene. Second, the consistency and continuity of the appearance of objects between successive frames are exploited to track the objects. With this tracking formulation, our method also benefits from training on large-scale general object-tracking datasets. We further curate a video-level hand-object interaction dataset for testing and evaluation from 100DOH. The quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in scenes with continuous interaction with different objects, we achieve an impressive improvement of about 10% as evaluated using the Average Precision (AP) metric. Our qualitative findings also illustrate that our method can produce more continuous trajectories for interacting objects.

Accurate detection and uncertainty quantification are both critical for onboard modules, such as perception, prediction, and planning, to improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles. Collaborative object detection (COD) has been proposed to improve detection accuracy and reduce uncertainty by leveraging the viewpoints of multiple agents. However, little attention has been paid to how to leverage the uncertainty quantification from COD to enhance MOT performance. In this paper, as the first attempt to address this challenge, we design an uncertainty propagation framework called MOT-CUP. Our framework first quantifies the uncertainty of COD through direct modeling and conformal prediction, and propagates this uncertainty information into the motion prediction and association steps. MOT-CUP is designed to work with different collaborative object detectors and baseline MOT algorithms. We evaluate MOT-CUP on V2X-Sim, a comprehensive collaborative perception dataset, and demonstrate a 2% improvement in accuracy and a 2.67X reduction in uncertainty compared to the baselines, e.g. SORT and ByteTrack. In scenarios characterized by high occlusion levels, our MOT-CUP demonstrates a noteworthy $4.01\%$ improvement in accuracy. MOT-CUP demonstrates the importance of uncertainty quantification in both COD and MOT, and provides the first attempt to improve the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in MOT based on COD through uncertainty propagation.

To resolve this limitation, we have witnessed advanced LiDAR sensors become popular in perception tasks in autonomous driving applications. Nevertheless, their usage in traffic monitoring systems is less ubiquitous. We identify two significant obstacles in cost-effectively and efficiently developing such a LiDAR-based traffic monitoring system: (i) public LiDAR datasets are insufficient for supporting perception tasks in infrastructure systems, and (ii) 3D annotations on LiDAR point clouds are time-consuming and expensive. To fill this gap, we present an efficient semi-automated annotation tool that automatically annotates LiDAR sequences with tracking algorithms while offering a fully annotated infrastructure LiDAR dataset -- FLORIDA (Florida LiDAR-based Object Recognition and Intelligent Data Annotation) -- which will be made publicly available. Our advanced annotation tool seamlessly integrates multi-object tracking (MOT), single-object tracking (SOT), and suitable trajectory post-processing techniques. Specifically, we introduce a human-in-the-loop schema in which annotators recursively fix and refine annotations imperfectly predicted by our tool and incrementally add them to the training dataset to obtain better SOT and MOT models. By repeating the process, we significantly increase the overall annotation speed by three to four times and obtain better qualitative annotations than a state-of-the-art annotation tool. The human annotation experiments verify the effectiveness of our annotation tool. In addition, we provide detailed statistics and object detection evaluation results for our dataset in serving as a benchmark for perception tasks at traffic intersections.

To this end, we introduce VideoSAM, an end-to-end framework designed to address these challenges by improving object tracking and segmentation consistency in dynamic environments. VideoSAM integrates an agglomerated backbone, RADIO, enabling object association through similarity metrics and introduces Cycle-ack-Pairs Propagation with a memory mechanism for stable object tracking.

The global nearest neighbor (GNN) filter, as the earliest random vector-based Bayesian tracking framework, has been adopted in most of state-of-the-arts trackers in the automotive industry. The development of random finite set (RFS) theory facilitates a mathematically rigorous treatment of the MOT problem, and different variants of RFS-based Bayesian filters have then been proposed. However, their effectiveness in the real ADAS and AD application is still an open problem. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the latest RFS-based Bayesian tracking framework could be superior to typical random vector-based Bayesian tracking framework via a systematic comparative study of both traditional random vector-based Bayesian filters with rule-based heuristic track maintenance and RFS-based Bayesian filters on the nuScenes validation dataset. An RFS-based tracker, namely Poisson multi-Bernoulli filter using the global nearest neighbor (GNN-PMB), is proposed to LiDAR-based MOT tasks. This GNN-PMB tracker is simple to use, and it achieves competitive results on the nuScenes dataset. Specifically, the proposed GNN-PMB tracker outperforms most state-of-the-art LiDAR-only trackers and LiDAR and camera fusion-based trackers, ranking the $3^{rd}$ among all LiDAR-only trackers on nuScenes 3D tracking challenge leader board at the time of submission.

Open-Vocabulary Semantic Exploration in Real-World Semi-Static Environments</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>Robots deployed in real-world environments, such as homes, must not only navigate safely but also understand their surroundings and adapt to environment changes. To perform tasks efficiently, they must build and maintain a semantic map that accurately reflects the current state of the environment. Existing research on semantic exploration largely focuses on static scenes without persistent object-level instance tracking. A consistent map is, however, crucial for real-world robotic applications where objects in the environment can be removed, reintroduced, or shifted over time. In this work, to close this gap, we propose an open-vocabulary, semantic exploration system for semi-static environments. Our system maintains a consistent map by building a probabilistic model of object instance stationarity, systematically tracking semi-static changes, and actively exploring areas that have not been visited for a prolonged period of time. In addition to active map maintenance, our approach leverages the map's semantic richness with LLM-based reasoning for open-vocabulary object-goal navigation. This enables the robot to search more efficiently by prioritizing contextually relevant areas. We evaluate our approach across multiple real-world semi-static environments. Our system detects 95% of map changes on average, improving efficiency by more than 29% as compared to random and patrol baselines. Overall, our approach achieves a mapping precision within 2% of a fully rebuilt map while requiring substantially less exploration and further completes object goal navigation tasks about 14% faster than the next-best tested strategy (coverage patrolling).

However, conventional tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes, which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on nuScenes 3D MOT.

Our empirical study reveals that while scaling each factor leads to significant improvements in tracking accuracy, naive training suffers from suboptimal optimization and limited iterative refinement. To address this issue, we introduce DT-Training, a progressive scaling framework that integrates small teacher transfer and dual-branch alignment to maximize model potential. The resulting scaled tracker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and transferability of the proposed method. Furthermore, we validate the broader applicability of our approach to additional tasks, underscoring its versatility beyond tracking.

Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR and KITTI show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our code will be released on https://lolrudy.github.io/No3DTrackSG/.

Existing methods often struggle with sparse and incomplete point cloud scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal-guided Virtual Cues Projection (MVCP) scheme that generates virtual cues to enrich sparse point clouds. Additionally, we introduce an enhanced tracker MVCTrack based on the generated virtual cues. Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to create dense 3D virtual cues that significantly improve the sparsity of point clouds. These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D trackers, yielding substantial performance gains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the NuScenes dataset.

To obtain highly accurate perception results, modern autonomous driving systems typically employ multi-modal sensors to collect comprehensive environmental data. Among these, the radar-camera multi-modal perception system is especially favored for its excellent sensing capabilities and cost-effectiveness. However, the substantial modality differences between radar and camera sensors pose challenges in fusing information. To address this problem, this paper presents RCBEVDet, a radar-camera fusion 3D object detection framework. Specifically, RCBEVDet is developed from an existing camera-based 3D object detector, supplemented by a specially designed radar feature extractor, RadarBEVNet, and a Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion (CAMF) module. Firstly, RadarBEVNet encodes sparse radar points into a dense bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature using a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross Section aware BEV encoder. Secondly, the CAMF module utilizes a deformable attention mechanism to align radar and camera BEV features and adopts channel and spatial fusion layers to fuse them. To further enhance RCBEVDet's capabilities, we introduce RCBEVDet++, which advances the CAMF through sparse fusion, supports query-based multi-view camera perception models, and adapts to a broader range of perception tasks. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes show that our method integrates seamlessly with existing camera-based 3D perception models and improves their performance across various perception tasks. Furthermore, our method achieves state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results in 3D object detection, BEV semantic segmentation, and 3D multi-object tracking tasks. Notably, with ViT-L as the image backbone, RCBEVDet++ achieves 72.73 NDS and 67.34 mAP in 3D object detection without test-time augmentation or model ensembling.

Recent end-to-end query-based trackers simultaneously detect and track objects, which have shown promising potential for the 3D MOT task. However, existing methods are still in the early stages of development and lack systematic improvements, failing to track objects in certain complex scenarios, like occlusions and the small size of target object's situations. In this paper, we first summarize the current end-to-end 3D MOT framework by decomposing it into three constituent parts: query initialization, query propagation, and query matching. Then we propose corresponding improvements, which lead to a strong yet simple tracker: S2-Track. Specifically, for query initialization, we present 2D-Prompted Query Initialization, which leverages predicted 2D object and depth information to prompt an initial estimate of the object's 3D location. For query propagation, we introduce an Uncertainty-aware Probabilistic Decoder to capture the uncertainty of complex environment in object prediction with probabilistic attention. For query matching, we propose a Hierarchical Query Denoising strategy to enhance training robustness and convergence. As a result, our S2-Track achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark, i.e., 66.3% AMOTA on test split, surpassing the previous best end-to-end solution by a significant margin of 8.9% AMOTA. We achieve 1st place on the nuScenes tracking task leaderboard.

In recent years, video instance segmentation, which aims to track and segment multiple objects in video frames, has drawn much attention for its potential applications in various emerging areas such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and smart retail. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for instance-level visual analysis on video frames, which can simultaneously conduct object detection, instance segmentation, and multi-object tracking. The core idea of our method is collaborative multi-task learning which is achieved by a novel structure, named associative connections among detection, segmentation, and tracking task heads in an end-to-end learnable CNN. These additional connections allow information propagation across multiple related tasks, so as to benefit these tasks simultaneously. We evaluate the proposed method extensively on KITTI MOTS and MOTS Challenge datasets and obtain quite encouraging results.

Motivated by the fact that annotating data for the multi-object tracking (MOT) problem is immensely expensive, recent studies have turned their attention to the unsupervised learning setting. In this paper, we push forward the state-of-the-art performance of unsupervised MOT methods by proposing UnsMOT, a novel framework that explicitly combines the appearance and motion features of objects with geometric information to provide more accurate tracking. Specifically, we first extract the appearance and motion features using CNN and RNN models, respectively. Then, we construct a graph of objects based on their relative distances in a frame, which is fed into a GNN model together with CNN features to output geometric embedding of objects optimized using an unsupervised loss function. Finally, associations between objects are found by matching not only similar extracted features but also geometric embedding of detections and tracklets. Experimental results show remarkable performance in terms of HOTA, IDF1, and MOTA metrics in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

It has been one of the key bottlenecks that prevents Level 5 autonomy. Recent research has demonstrated that the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception system has great potential to revolutionize the autonomous driving industry. However, the lack of a real-world dataset hinders the progress of this field. To facilitate the development of cooperative perception, we present V2V4Real, the first large-scale real-world multi-modal dataset for V2V perception. The data is collected by two vehicles equipped with multi-modal sensors driving together through diverse scenarios. Our V2V4Real dataset covers a driving area of 410 km, comprising 20K LiDAR frames, 40K RGB frames, 240K annotated 3D bounding boxes for 5 classes, and HDMaps that cover all the driving routes. V2V4Real introduces three perception tasks, including cooperative 3D object detection, cooperative 3D object tracking, and Sim2Real domain adaptation for cooperative perception. We provide comprehensive benchmarks of recent cooperative perception algorithms on three tasks. The V2V4Real dataset can be found at https://research.seas.ucla.edu/mobility-lab/v2v4real/.

Accurate RCM tool control is vital for incorporating autonomous subtasks like suturing, blood suction, and tumor resection into robotic surgical procedures, reducing surgeon fatigue and improving patient outcomes. However, these cable-driven systems are subject to significant joint reading errors, corrupting the kinematics computation necessary to perform control. Although visual tracking with endoscopic cameras can correct errors on in-view joints, errors in the kinematic chain prior to the insertion point are irreparable because they remain out of view. No prior work has characterized the stability of control under these conditions. We fill this gap by designing a provably stable tracking-in-the-loop controller for the out-of-view portion of the RCM manipulator kinematic chain. We additionally incorporate this controller into a bilevel control scheme for the full kinematic chain. We rigorously benchmark our method in simulated and real world settings to verify our theoretical findings. Our work provides key insights into the next steps required for the transition from teleoperated to autonomous surgery.

This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.

However, existing methods predominantly exploit camera detections to correct tracking failures caused by potential LiDAR detection problems, neglecting the reciprocal benefit of refining camera detections using LiDAR data. This limitation is rooted in their single-stage architecture, akin to single-stage object detectors, lacking a dedicated trajectory refinement module to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal information. To this end, we introduce CrossTracker, a novel two-stage paradigm for online multi-modal 3D MOT. CrossTracker operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, initially generating coarse trajectories and subsequently refining them through an independent refinement process. Specifically, CrossTracker incorporates three essential modules: i) a multi-modal modeling (M^3) module that, by fusing multi-modal information (images, point clouds, and even plane geometry extracted from images), provides a robust metric for subsequent trajectory generation. ii) a coarse trajectory generation (C-TG) module that generates initial coarse dual-stream trajectories, and iii) a trajectory refinement (TR) module that refines coarse trajectories through cross correction between camera and LiDAR streams. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our CrossTracker over its eighteen competitors, underscoring its effectiveness in harnessing the synergistic benefits of camera and LiDAR sensors for robust multi-modal 3D MOT.

Existing algorithms attempt to address the challenges in two strategies. The first strategy is to learn dense geometric features based on the captured sparse point cloud. Nevertheless, it is quite a formidable task since the learned dense geometric features are with high uncertainty for depicting the shape of the target object. The other strategy is to aggregate the sparse geometric features of multiple templates to enrich the shape information, which is a routine solution in 2D tracking. However, aggregating the coarse shape representations can hardly yield a precise shape representation. Different from 2D pixels, 3D points of different frames can be directly fused by coordinate transform, i.e., shape completion. Considering that, we propose to construct a synthetic target representation composed of dense and complete point clouds depicting the target shape precisely by shape completion for robust 3D tracking. Specifically, we design a voxelized 3D tracking framework with shape completion, in which we propose a quality-aware shape completion mechanism to alleviate the adverse effect of noisy historical predictions. It enables us to effectively construct and leverage the synthetic target representation. Besides, we also develop a voxelized relation modeling module and box refinement module to improve tracking performance. Favorable performance against state-of-the-art algorithms on three benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method.

Unfortunately, they lack two key properties: objects are often split into parts and are not consistently tracked over time. In fact, state-of-the-art models achieve pixel-level accuracy and temporal consistency by relying on supervised object detection with additional ID labels for the association through time. This paper proposes a video object-centric model for MOT. It consists of an index-merge module that adapts the object-centric slots into detection outputs and an object memory module that builds complete object prototypes to handle occlusions. Benefited from object-centric learning, we only require sparse detection labels (0%-6.25%) for object localization and feature binding. Relying on our self-supervised Expectation-Maximization-inspired loss for object association, our approach requires no ID labels. Our experiments significantly narrow the gap between the existing object-centric model and the fully supervised state-of-the-art and outperform several unsupervised trackers.

This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

Our approach combines the off-the-shelf active tracking methods with VLMs' reasoning capabilities, deploying a fast visual policy for normal tracking and activating VLM reasoning only upon failure detection. The framework features a memory-augmented self-reflection mechanism that enables the VLM to progressively improve by learning from past experiences, effectively addressing VLMs' limitations in 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements, with our framework boosting success rates by $72\%$ with state-of-the-art RL-based approaches and $220\%$ with PID-based methods in challenging environments. This work represents the first integration of VLM-based reasoning to assist EVT agents in proactive failure recovery, offering substantial advances for real-world robotic applications that require continuous target monitoring in dynamic, unstructured environments.

While recent advancements in language models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs, VLAs) have improved instruction comprehension, these models face critical limitations in either inference speed (LLMs, VLMs) or generalizability (VLAs) for UC-EVT tasks. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hierarchical Instruction-aware Embodied Visual Tracking (HIEVT)} agent, which bridges instruction comprehension and action generation using \textit{spatial goals} as intermediaries. HIEVT first introduces \textit{LLM-based Semantic-Spatial Goal Aligner} to translate diverse human instructions into spatial goals that directly annotate the desired spatial position. Then the \textit{RL-based Adaptive Goal-Aligned Policy}, a general offline policy, enables the tracker to position the target as specified by the spatial goal. To benchmark UC-EVT tasks, we collect over ten million trajectories for training and evaluate across one seen environment and nine unseen challenging environments. Extensive experiments and real-world deployments demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of HIEVT across diverse environments, varying target dynamics, and complex instruction combinations.

This is because UAV-MOT faces both local object motion and global camera motion. Motion blur also increases the difficulty of detecting large moving objects. Previous UAV motion modeling approaches either focus only on local motion or ignore motion blurring effects, thus limiting their tracking performance and speed. To address these issues, we propose the Motion Mamba Module, which explores both local and global motion features through cross-correlation and bi-directional Mamba Modules for better motion modeling. To address the detection difficulties caused by motion blur, we also design motion margin loss to effectively improve the detection accuracy of motion blurred objects. Based on the Motion Mamba module and motion margin loss, our proposed MM-Tracker surpasses the state-of-the-art in two widely open-source UAV-MOT datasets. Code will be available.

For parking scenarios, dynamic lighting, sparse textures, and the instability of global positioning system (GPS) signals pose challenges for most traditional localization methods. To address these difficulties, we propose VIPS-Odom, a novel semantic visual-inertial odometry framework for underground autonomous parking, which adopts tightly-coupled optimization to fuse measurements from multi-modal sensors and solves odometry. Our VIPS-Odom integrates parking slots detected from the synthesized bird-eye-view (BEV) image with traditional feature points in the frontend, and conducts tightly-coupled optimization with joint constraints introduced by measurements from the inertial measurement unit, wheel speed sensor and parking slots in the backend. We develop a multi-object tracking framework to robustly track parking slots' states. To prove the superiority of our method, we equip an electronic vehicle with related sensors and build an experimental platform based on ROS2 system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and advantages of our method compared with other baselines for parking scenarios.

These challenges can be addressed by robot-assisted endoscope systems which provide precise and stabilized positioning, as well as constrained and smooth motion control of the endoscope. In this work, we propose an online hierarchical optimization framework for visual servoing control of the endoscope in MIS. The framework prioritizes maintaining a remote-center-of-motion (RCM) constraint to prevent tissue damage, while a visual tracking task is defined as a secondary task to enable autonomous tracking of visual features of interest. We validated our approach using a 6-DOF Denso VS050 manipulator and achieved optimization solving times under 0.4 ms and maximum RCM deviation of approximately 0.4 mm. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing the constrained motion planning challenges of MIS, enabling precise and autonomous endoscope positioning and visual tracking.

This setting reflects many challenges of real-world robotics, including active perception, agile full-body control, and long-horizon planning in a dynamic, partially-observable, multi-agent domain. We rely on large-scale, simulation-based data generation to obtain complex behaviors from egocentric vision which can be successfully transferred to physical robots using low-cost sensors. To achieve adequate visual realism, our simulation combines rigid-body physics with learned, realistic rendering via multiple Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). We combine teacher-based multi-agent RL and cross-experiment data reuse to enable the discovery of sophisticated soccer strategies. We analyze active-perception behaviors including object tracking and ball seeking that emerge when simply optimizing perception-agnostic soccer play. The agents display equivalent levels of performance and agility as policies with access to privileged, ground-truth state. To our knowledge, this paper constitutes a first demonstration of end-to-end training for multi-agent robot soccer, mapping raw pixel observations to joint-level actions, that can be deployed in the real world.

Moreover, this infrastructure can also be used for other computer vision tasks, such as the evaluation of Visual (-Inertial) SLAM dynamic initialization, multi-object tracking, or automatic annotation. Yet, to work optimally, these functionalities require having accurate and reliable spatial-temporal calibration parameters between the camera and the global pose sensor. In this study, we provide two novel solutions to estimate these calibration parameters. Firstly, we design an offline target-based method with high accuracy and consistency. Spatial-temporal parameters, camera intrinsic, and trajectory are optimized simultaneously. Then, we propose an online target-less method, eliminating the need for a calibration target and enabling the estimation of time-varying spatial-temporal parameters. Additionally, we perform detailed observability analysis for the target-less method. Our theoretical findings regarding observability are validated by simulation experiments and provide explainable guidelines for calibration. Finally, the accuracy and consistency of two proposed methods are evaluated with hand-held real-world datasets where traditional hand-eye calibration method do not work.

So inferring the scene dynamics from sensor readings without explicit object tracking is a pivotal aspect of foresighted navigation among pedestrians. In this paper, we introduce a spatiotemporal attention pipeline for enhanced navigation based on 2D~lidar sensor readings. This pipeline is complemented by a novel lidar-state representation that emphasizes dynamic obstacles over static ones. Subsequently, the attention mechanism enables selective scene perception across both space and time, resulting in improved overall navigation performance within dynamic scenarios. We thoroughly evaluated the approach in different scenarios and simulators, finding excellent generalization to unseen environments. The results demonstrate outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, thereby enabling the seamless deployment of the learned controller on a real robot.

However, a single image patch cannot provide a complete and precise concept of the target object as images are limited in their ability to abstract and can be ambiguous, which makes it difficult to track targets with drastic variations. In this paper, we propose the CiteTracker to enhance target modeling and inference in visual tracking by connecting images and text. Specifically, we develop a text generation module to convert the target image patch into a descriptive text containing its class and attribute information, providing a comprehensive reference point for the target. In addition, a dynamic description module is designed to adapt to target variations for more effective target representation. We then associate the target description and the search image using an attention-based correlation module to generate the correlated features for target state reference. Extensive experiments on five diverse datasets are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm and the favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed tracking method.

Rather than constructing a complex cross-modal fusion network, we explore the great potential of a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT). Particularly, we delicately investigate plug-and-play training augmentations that encourage the ViT to bridge the vast distribution gap between the two modalities, enabling comprehensive cross-modal information interaction and thus enhancing its ability. Specifically, we propose a mask modeling strategy that randomly masks a specific modality of some tokens to enforce the interaction between tokens from different modalities interacting proactively. To mitigate network oscillations resulting from the masking strategy and further amplify its positive effect, we then theoretically propose an orthogonal high-rank loss to regularize the attention matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play training augmentation techniques can significantly boost state-of-the-art one-stream and twostream trackers to a large extent in terms of both tracking precision and success rate. Our new perspective and findings will potentially bring insights to the field of leveraging powerful pre-trained ViTs to model cross-modal data. The code will be publicly available.

Over the past few years, the fast progress in data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) has brought a fast-increasing trend to empower MSF systems by deep learning techniques to further improve performance, especially on intelligent systems and their perception systems. Although quite a few AI-enabled MSF perception systems and techniques have been proposed, up to the present, limited benchmarks that focus on MSF perception are publicly available. Given that many intelligent systems such as self-driving cars are operated in safety-critical contexts where perception systems play an important role, there comes an urgent need for a more in-depth understanding of the performance and reliability of these MSF systems. To bridge this gap, we initiate an early step in this direction and construct a public benchmark of AI-enabled MSF-based perception systems including three commonly adopted tasks (i.e., object detection, object tracking, and depth completion). Based on this, to comprehensively understand MSF systems' robustness and reliability, we design 14 common and realistic corruption patterns to synthesize large-scale corrupted datasets. We further perform a systematic evaluation of these systems through our large-scale evaluation. Our results reveal the vulnerability of the current AI-enabled MSF perception systems, calling for researchers and practitioners to take robustness and reliability into account when designing AI-enabled MSF.

AOT has wide-ranging applications, such as in mobile robots and autonomous driving. However, building a generalizable active tracker that works robustly across different scenarios remains a challenge, especially in unstructured environments with cluttered obstacles and diverse layouts. We argue that constructing a state representation capable of modeling the geometry structure of the surroundings and the dynamics of the target is crucial for achieving this goal. To address this challenge, we present RSPT, a framework that forms a structure-aware motion representation by Reconstructing the Surroundings and Predicting the target Trajectory. Additionally, we enhance the generalization of the policy network by training in an asymmetric dueling mechanism. We evaluate RSPT on various simulated scenarios and show that it outperforms existing methods in unseen environments, particularly those with complex obstacles and layouts. We also demonstrate the successful transfer of RSPT to real-world settings. Project Website: https://sites.google.com/view/aot-rspt.

This paper introduces, AirTrack, a real-time vision-only detect and tracking framework that respects the size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints of sUAS systems. Given the low Signal-to-Noise ratios (SNR) of far away aircraft, we propose using full resolution images in a deep learning framework that aligns successive images to remove ego-motion. The aligned images are then used downstream in cascaded primary and secondary classifiers to improve detection and tracking performance on multiple metrics. We show that AirTrack outperforms state-of-the art baselines on the Amazon Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) Dataset. Multiple real world flight tests with a Cessna 182 interacting with general aviation traffic and additional near-collision flight tests with a Bell helicopter flying towards a UAS in a controlled setting showcase that the proposed approach satisfies the newly introduced ASTM F3442/F3442M standard for DAA.

To eliminate expensive and exhaustive annotation, we study self-supervised learning for visual tracking. In this work, we develop the Crop-Transform-Paste operation, which is able to synthesize sufficient training data by simulating various appearance variations during tracking, including appearance variations of objects and background interference. Since the target state is known in all synthesized data, existing deep trackers can be trained in routine ways using the synthesized data without human annotation. The proposed target-aware data-synthesis method adapts existing tracking approaches within a self-supervised learning framework without algorithmic changes. Thus, the proposed self-supervised learning mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into existing tracking frameworks to perform training. Extensive experiments show that our method 1) achieves favorable performance against supervised learning schemes under the cases with limited annotations; 2) helps deal with various tracking challenges such as object deformation, occlusion, or background clutter due to its manipulability; 3) performs favorably against state-of-the-art unsupervised tracking methods; 4) boosts the performance of various state-of-the-art supervised learning frameworks, including SiamRPN++, DiMP, and TransT.

The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging benchmark.

Unlike traditional reactive methods, these systems rely on real-time sensing, trajectory prediction, and intelligent infrastructure to detect potential hazards. Existing simulation-based studies often overlook, and real-world deployment studies rarely discuss the practical challenges associated with deploying such systems in operational settings, particularly those involving roadside infrastructure and multi-sensor integration and fusion. This study addresses that gap by presenting deployment insights and technical lessons learned from a real-world implementation of a multi-sensor safety system at an active bridge repair work zone along the N-2/US-75 corridor in Lincoln, Nebraska. The deployed system combines LiDAR, radar, and camera sensors with an edge computing platform to support multi-modal object tracking, trajectory fusion, and real-time analytics. Specifically, this study presents key lessons learned across three critical stages of deployment: (1) sensor selection and placement, (2) sensor calibration, system integration, and validation, and (3) sensor fusion. Additionally, we propose a predictive digital twin framework that leverages fused trajectory data for early conflict detection and real-time warning generation, enabling proactive safety interventions.

However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

However, these approaches often neglect potential enhancements in 3D detection processes, leading to high false positives (FP), missed detections (FN), and identity switches (IDS), particularly in challenging scenarios such as crowded scenes, small-object configurations, and adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, limitations in data preprocessing, association mechanisms, motion modeling, and life-cycle management hinder overall tracking robustness. To address these issues, we present Easy-Poly, a real-time, filter-based 3D MOT framework for multiple object categories. Our contributions include: (1) An Augmented Proposal Generator utilizing multi-modal data augmentation and refined SpConv operations, significantly improving mAP and NDS on nuScenes; (2) A Dynamic Track-Oriented (DTO) data association algorithm that effectively manages uncertainties and occlusions through optimal assignment and multiple hypothesis handling; (3) A Dynamic Motion Modeling (DMM) incorporating a confidence-weighted Kalman filter and adaptive noise covariances, enhancing MOTA and AMOTA in challenging conditions; and (4) An extended life-cycle management system with adjustive thresholds to reduce ID switches and false terminations. Experimental results show that Easy-Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Poly-MOT and Fast-Poly, achieving notable gains in mAP (e.g., from 63.30% to 64.96% with LargeKernel3D) and AMOTA (e.g., from 73.1% to 74.5%), while also running in real-time. These findings highlight Easy-Poly's adaptability and robustness in diverse scenarios, making it a compelling choice for autonomous driving and related 3D MOT applications. The source code of this paper will be published upon acceptance.

INTACT combines meta-learning with adversarial curriculum training (ACT) to systematically address challenges posed by data corruption and sparsity in 3D point clouds. The meta-learning phase equips a teacher network with task-agnostic priors, enabling it to generate robust saliency maps that identify critical data regions. The ACT phase leverages these saliency maps to progressively expose a student network to increasingly complex noise patterns, ensuring targeted perturbation and improved noise resilience. INTACT's effectiveness is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on object detection, tracking, and classification benchmarks using diverse datasets, including KITTI, Argoverse, and ModelNet40. Results indicate that INTACT improves model robustness by up to 20% across all tasks, outperforming standard adversarial and curriculum training methods. This framework not only addresses the limitations of conventional training strategies but also offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-world deployment in resource-constrained safety-critical systems. INTACT's principled integration of meta-learning and adversarial training establishes a new paradigm for noise-tolerant 3D perception in safety-critical applications. INTACT improved KITTI Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) by 9.6% (64.1% -> 75.1%) and by 12.4% under Gaussian noise (52.5% -> 73.7%). Similarly, KITTI mean Average Precision (mAP) rose from 59.8% to 69.8% (50% point drop) and 49.3% to 70.9% (Gaussian noise), highlighting the framework's ability to enhance deep learning model resilience in safety-critical object tracking scenarios.

However, real-time tracking in complex maritime environments is challenging due to dynamic camera movement, low visibility, and scale variation. Typically, object detection methods combined with filtering techniques are commonly used for tracking, but they often lack robustness, particularly in the presence of camera motion and missed detections. Although advanced tracking methods have been proposed recently, their application in maritime scenarios is limited. To address this gap, this study proposes a vision-guided object-tracking framework for USVs, integrating state-of-the-art tracking algorithms with low-level control systems to enable precise tracking in dynamic maritime environments. We benchmarked the performance of seven distinct trackers, developed using advanced deep learning techniques such as Siamese Networks and Transformers, by evaluating them on both simulated and real-world maritime datasets. In addition, we evaluated the robustness of various control algorithms in conjunction with these tracking systems. The proposed framework was validated through simulations and real-world sea experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling dynamic maritime conditions. The results show that SeqTrack, a Transformer-based tracker, performed best in adverse conditions, such as dust storms. Among the control algorithms evaluated, the linear quadratic regulator controller (LQR) demonstrated the most robust and smooth control, allowing for stable tracking of the USV.

While pedestrian tracking has advanced with Tracking-by-Detection MOT, team sports like basketball pose unique challenges. These challenges include players' unpredictable movements, frequent close interactions, and visual similarities that complicate pose labeling and lead to significant occlusions, frequent ID switches, and high manual annotation costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pose-based virtual marker (VM) MOT method for team sports, named Sports-vmTracking. This method builds on the vmTracking approach developed for multi-animal tracking with active learning. First, we constructed a 3x3 basketball pose dataset for VMs and applied active learning to enhance model performance in generating VMs. Then, we overlaid the VMs on video to identify players, extract their poses with unique IDs, and convert these into bounding boxes for comparison with automated MOT methods. Using our 3x3 basketball dataset, we demonstrated that our VM configuration has been highly effective, and reduced the need for manual corrections and labeling during pose model training while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach achieved an average HOTA score of 72.3%, over 10 points higher than other state-of-the-art methods without VM, and resulted in 0 ID switches. Beyond improving performance in handling occlusions and minimizing ID switches, our framework could substantially increase the time and cost efficiency compared to traditional manual annotation.

In this paper, we present an effective path-planning system leveraging semantic segmentation information to navigate around texture-less and problematic areas like lakes, oceans, and high-rise buildings using a monocular camera. We introduce a real-time semantic segmentation architecture and a novel keyframe decision pipeline to optimize image inputs based on pixel distribution, reducing processing time. A hierarchical planner based on the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) algorithm, integrated with a cost map, is designed to facilitate efficient path planning. The system is implemented in a photo-realistic simulation environment using Unity, aligning with segmentation model parameters. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing significant improvements in the reliability and efficiency of UAV localization in challenging environments.

Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods.

Traditional phytoplankton monitoring methods are often complex and lack timely analysis. Therefore, deep learning algorithms offer a promising approach for automated phytoplankton monitoring. However, the lack of large-scale, high-quality training samples has become a major bottleneck in advancing phytoplankton tracking. In this paper, we propose a challenging benchmark dataset, Multiple Phytoplankton Tracking (MPT), which covers diverse background information and variations in motion during observation. The dataset includes 27 species of phytoplankton and zooplankton, 14 different backgrounds to simulate diverse and complex underwater environments, and a total of 140 videos. To enable accurate real-time observation of phytoplankton, we introduce a multi-object tracking method, Deviation-Corrected Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Tracker(DSFT), which addresses issues such as focus shifts during tracking and the loss of small target information when computing frame-to-frame similarity. Specifically, we introduce an additional feature extractor to predict the residuals of the standard feature extractor's output, and compute multi-scale frame-to-frame similarity based on features from different layers of the extractor. Extensive experiments on the MPT have demonstrated the validity of the dataset and the superiority of DSFT in tracking phytoplankton, providing an effective solution for phytoplankton monitoring.

Diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in visual generation, making them well-suited for addressing several requirements of the tracking problem. This work proposes a novel diffusion-based methodology to formulate the tracking task. Firstly, their conditional process allows for injecting indications of the target object into the generation process. Secondly, diffusion mechanics can be developed to inherently model temporal correspondences, enabling the reconstruction of actual frames in video. However, existing diffusion models rely on extensive and unnecessary mapping to a Gaussian noise domain, which can be replaced by a more efficient and stable interpolation process. Our proposed interpolation mechanism draws inspiration from classic image-processing techniques, offering a more interpretable, stable, and faster approach tailored specifically for the object tracking task. By leveraging the strengths of diffusion models while circumventing their limitations, our Diffusion-based INterpolation TrackeR (DINTR) presents a promising new paradigm and achieves a superior multiplicity on seven benchmarks across five indicator representations.

Traditionally, parametric techniques have been employed for this task. However, recent advancements have seen a shift towards learning-based methods. Given the rapid pace of research and the frequent introduction of new image matching methods, it is essential to evaluate them. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various image matching methods using a structure-from-motion pipeline. We assess the performance of these methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, identifying key limitations in both the methods and benchmarks. We also investigate the impact of edge detection as a pre-processing step. Our analysis reveals that image matching for 3D reconstruction remains an open challenge, necessitating careful selection and tuning of models for specific scenarios, while also highlighting mismatches in how metrics currently represent method performance.

In this paper, we introduce Medical SAM 2 (MedSAM-2), a generalized auto-tracking model for universal 2D and 3D medical image segmentation. The core concept is to leverage the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) pipeline to treat all 2D and 3D medical segmentation tasks as a video object tracking problem. To put it into practice, we propose a novel \emph{self-sorting memory bank} mechanism that dynamically selects informative embeddings based on confidence and dissimilarity, regardless of temporal order. This mechanism not only significantly improves performance in 3D medical image segmentation but also unlocks a \emph{One-Prompt Segmentation} capability for 2D images, allowing segmentation across multiple images from a single prompt without temporal relationships. We evaluated MedSAM-2 on five 2D tasks and nine 3D tasks, including white blood cells, optic cups, retinal vessels, mandibles, coronary arteries, kidney tumors, liver tumors, breast cancer, nasopharynx cancer, vestibular schwannoma, mediastinal lymph nodules, cerebral artery, inferior alveolar nerve, and abdominal organs, comparing it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in task-tailored, general and interactive segmentation settings. Our findings demonstrate that MedSAM-2 surpasses a wide range of existing models and updates new SOTA on several benchmarks.

The current MOT methods mainly focus on pedestrian or vehicle scenes, but basketball sports scenes are usually accompanied by three or more object occlusion problems with similar appearances and high-intensity complex motions, which we call complex multi-object occlusion (CMOO). Here, we propose an online and robust MOT approach, named Basketball-SORT, which focuses on the CMOO problems in basketball videos. To overcome the CMOO problem, instead of using the intersection-over-union-based (IoU-based) approach, we use the trajectories of neighboring frames based on the projected positions of the players. Our method designs the basketball game restriction (BGR) and reacquiring Long-Lost IDs (RLLI) based on the characteristics of basketball scenes, and we also solve the occlusion problem based on the player trajectories and appearance features. Experimental results show that our method achieves a Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) score of 63.48$\%$ on the basketball fixed video dataset and outperforms other recent popular approaches. Overall, our approach solved the CMOO problem more effectively than recent MOT algorithms.

Pre-training is essential for extracting a universal representation. However, current vision-centric pre-training typically relies on either 2D or 3D pre-text tasks, overlooking the temporal characteristics of autonomous driving as a 4D scene understanding task. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a world model-based autonomous driving 4D representation learning framework, dubbed \emph{DriveWorld}, which is capable of pre-training from multi-camera driving videos in a spatio-temporal fashion. Specifically, we propose a Memory State-Space Model for spatio-temporal modelling, which consists of a Dynamic Memory Bank module for learning temporal-aware latent dynamics to predict future changes and a Static Scene Propagation module for learning spatial-aware latent statics to offer comprehensive scene contexts. We additionally introduce a Task Prompt to decouple task-aware features for various downstream tasks. The experiments demonstrate that DriveWorld delivers promising results on various autonomous driving tasks. When pre-trained with the OpenScene dataset, DriveWorld achieves a 7.5% increase in mAP for 3D object detection, a 3.0% increase in IoU for online mapping, a 5.0% increase in AMOTA for multi-object tracking, a 0.1m decrease in minADE for motion forecasting, a 3.0% increase in IoU for occupancy prediction, and a 0.34m reduction in average L2 error for planning.

While this approach has allowed for empirical accuracy, efficiency, and task adaptation via fine-tuning, it also comes with fundamental disadvantages. Existing networks often struggle to generalize across different datasets, even on the same task. By design, these networks ultimately reason about high-dimensional scene features, which are challenging to analyze. This is true especially when attempting to predict 3D information based on 2D images. We propose to recast 3D multi-object tracking from RGB cameras as an \emph{Inverse Rendering (IR)} problem, by optimizing via a differentiable rendering pipeline over the latent space of pre-trained 3D object representations and retrieve the latents that best represent object instances in a given input image. To this end, we optimize an image loss over generative latent spaces that inherently disentangle shape and appearance properties. We investigate not only an alternate take on tracking but our method also enables examining the generated objects, reasoning about failure situations, and resolving ambiguous cases. We validate the generalization and scaling capabilities of our method by learning the generative prior exclusively from synthetic data and assessing camera-based 3D tracking on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. Both these datasets are completely unseen to our method and do not require fine-tuning. Videos and code are available at https://light.princeton.edu/inverse-rendering-tracking/.

Specifically, changes in the scene background not only render traditional frame-to-frame object IOU association methods ineffective but also introduce significant view shifts in the objects, which complicates tracking. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel universal HomView-MOT framework, which for the first time, harnesses the view Homography inherent in changing scenes to solve MOT challenges in moving environments, incorporating Homographic Matching and View-Centric concepts. We introduce a Fast Homography Estimation (FHE) algorithm for rapid computation of Homography matrices between video frames, enabling object View-Centric ID Learning (VCIL) and leveraging multi-view Homography to learn cross-view ID features. Concurrently, our Homographic Matching Filter (HMF) maps object bounding boxes from different frames onto a common view plane for a more realistic physical IOU association. Extensive experiments have proven that these innovations allow HomView-MOT to achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent UAV MOT datasets VisDrone and UAVDT.

While binarization from intensity images is crucial for extracting the embedded information in the bimodal objects, few previous works consider the task of binarization of blurry images due to the relative motion between the vision sensor and the environment. The blurry images can result in a loss in the binarization quality and thus degrade the downstream applications where the vision system is in motion. Recently, neuromorphic cameras offer new capabilities for alleviating motion blur, but it is non-trivial to first deblur and then binarize the images in a real-time manner. In this work, we propose an event-based binary reconstruction method that leverages the prior knowledge of the bimodal target's properties to perform inference independently in both event space and image space and merge the results from both domains to generate a sharp binary image. We also develop an efficient integration method to propagate this binary image to high frame rate binary video. Finally, we develop a novel method to naturally fuse events and images for unsupervised threshold identification. The proposed method is evaluated in publicly available and our collected data sequence, and shows the proposed method can outperform the SOTA methods to generate high frame rate binary video in real-time on CPU-only devices.

Various sensor modalities such as camera, radar, and lidar have been used to perform tasks such as object detection, segmentation, object tracking, and motion planning. A large subset of this research is focused on the video analysis, since most of the current vessel fleets contain the camera's onboard for various surveillance tasks. Due to the vast abundance of the video data, video scene change detection is an initial and crucial stage for scene understanding of USVs. This paper outlines our approach to detect dynamic scene changes in USVs. To the best of our understanding, this work represents the first investigation of scene change detection in the maritime vision application. Our objective is to identify significant changes in the dynamic scenes of maritime video data, particularly those scenes that exhibit a high degree of resemblance. In our system for dynamic scene change detection, we propose completely unsupervised learning method. In contrast to earlier studies, we utilize a modified cutting-edge generative picture model called VQ-VAE-2 to train on multiple marine datasets, aiming to enhance the feature extraction. Next, we introduce our innovative similarity scoring technique for directly calculating the level of similarity in a sequence of consecutive frames by utilizing grid calculation on retrieved features. The experiments were conducted using a nautical video dataset called RoboWhaler to showcase the efficient performance of our technique.

Despite its paramount significance, 3D MOT confronts a myriad of formidable challenges, encompassing abrupt alterations in object appearances, pervasive occlusion, the presence of diminutive targets, data sparsity, missed detections, and the unpredictable initiation and termination of object motion trajectories. Countless methodologies have emerged to grapple with these issues, yet 3D MOT endures as a formidable problem that warrants further exploration. This paper undertakes a comprehensive examination, assessment, and synthesis of the research landscape in this domain, remaining attuned to the latest developments in 3D MOT while suggesting prospective avenues for future investigation. Our exploration commences with a systematic exposition of key facets of 3D MOT and its associated domains, including problem delineation, classification, methodological approaches, fundamental principles, and empirical investigations. Subsequently, we categorize these methodologies into distinct groups, dissecting each group meticulously with regard to its challenges, underlying rationale, progress, merits, and demerits. Furthermore, we present a concise recapitulation of experimental metrics and offer an overview of prevalent datasets, facilitating a quantitative comparison for a more intuitive assessment. Lastly, our deliberations culminate in a discussion of the prevailing research landscape, highlighting extant challenges and charting possible directions for 3D MOT research. We present a structured and lucid road-map to guide forthcoming endeavors in this field.

Transformer-based end-to-end (E2E) solutions bring some ideas to MOT and MOTS, but they cannot achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in major MOT and MOTS benchmarks. Detection and association are two main modules of the tracking-by-detection paradigm. Association techniques mainly depend on the combination of motion and appearance information. As deep learning has been recently developed, the performance of the detection and appearance model is rapidly improved. These trends made us consider whether we can achieve SOTA based on only high-performance detection and appearance model. Our paper mainly focuses on exploring this direction based on CBNetV2 with Swin-B as a detection model and MoCo-v2 as a self-supervised appearance model. Motion information and IoU mapping were removed during the association. Our method wins 1st place on the MOTS track and wins 2nd on the MOT track in the CVPR2023 WAD workshop. We hope our simple and effective method can give some insights to the MOT and MOTS research community. Source code will be released under this git repository

While fully-supervised MOT methods have achieved high accuracy on existing datasets, they cannot generalize well on a newly obtained dataset or a new unseen domain. In this work, we first address the MOT problem from the cross-domain point of view, imitating the process of new data acquisition in practice. Then, a new cross-domain MOT adaptation from existing datasets is proposed without any pre-defined human knowledge in understanding and modeling objects. It can also learn and update itself from the target data feedback. The intensive experiments are designed on four challenging settings, including MOTSynth to MOT17, MOT17 to MOT20, MOT17 to VisDrone, and MOT17 to DanceTrack. We then prove the adaptability of the proposed self-supervised learning strategy. The experiments also show superior performance on tracking metrics MOTA and IDF1, compared to fully supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised state-of-the-art methods.

To address these issues, Generic Multiple Object Tracking (GMOT) has emerged as an alternative approach, requiring less prior information. However, current GMOT methods often rely on initial bounding boxes and struggle to handle variations in factors such as viewpoint, lighting, occlusion, and scale, among others. Our contributions commence with the introduction of the \textit{Referring GMOT dataset} a collection of videos, each accompanied by detailed textual descriptions of their attributes. Subsequently, we propose $\mathtt{Z-GMOT}$, a cutting-edge tracking solution capable of tracking objects from \textit{never-seen categories} without the need of initial bounding boxes or predefined categories. Within our $\mathtt{Z-GMOT}$ framework, we introduce two novel components: (i) $\mathtt{iGLIP}$, an improved Grounded language-image pretraining, for accurately detecting unseen objects with specific characteristics. (ii) $\mathtt{MA-SORT}$, a novel object association approach that adeptly integrates motion and appearance-based matching strategies to tackle the complex task of tracking objects with high similarity. Our contributions are benchmarked through extensive experiments conducted on the Referring GMOT dataset for GMOT task. Additionally, to assess the generalizability of the proposed $\mathtt{Z-GMOT}$, we conduct ablation studies on the DanceTrack and MOT20 datasets for the MOT task. Our dataset, code, and models are released at: https://fsoft-aic.github.io/Z-GMOT.

This approach can overcome some limitations of traditional methods that rely on bounding boxes or category annotations. This paper introduces a novel paradigm for Multiple Object Tracking called Type-to-Track, which allows users to track objects in videos by typing natural language descriptions. We present a new dataset for that Grounded Multiple Object Tracking task, called GroOT, that contains videos with various types of objects and their corresponding textual captions describing their appearance and action in detail. Additionally, we introduce two new evaluation protocols and formulate evaluation metrics specifically for this task. We develop a new efficient method that models a transformer-based eMbed-ENcoDE-extRact framework (MENDER) using the third-order tensor decomposition. The experiments in five scenarios show that our MENDER approach outperforms another two-stage design in terms of accuracy and efficiency, up to 14.7% accuracy and 4$\times$ speed faster.

To answer that, we introduce a point cloud representation learning framework, based on geometric feature reconstruction. In contrast to recent papers that directly adopt masked autoencoder (MAE) and only predict original coordinates or occupancy from masked point clouds, our method revisits differences between images and point clouds and identifies three self-supervised learning objectives peculiar to point clouds, namely centroid prediction, normal estimation, and curvature prediction. Combined with occupancy prediction, these four objectives yield an nontrivial self-supervised learning task and mutually facilitate models to better reason fine-grained geometry of point clouds. Our pipeline is conceptually simple and it consists of two major steps: first, it randomly masks out groups of points, followed by a Transformer-based point cloud encoder; second, a lightweight Transformer decoder predicts centroid, normal, and curvature for points in each voxel. We transfer the pre-trained Transformer encoder to a downstream peception model. On the nuScene Datset, our model achieves 3.38 mAP improvment for object detection, 2.1 mIoU gain for segmentation, and 1.7 AMOTA gain for multi-object tracking. We also conduct experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and achieve significant performance improvements over baselines as well.

We argue that this representation is limited and instead propose to guide and improve 2D tracking with an explicit object representation, namely the textured 3D shape and 6DoF pose in each video frame. Our representation tackles a complex long-term dense correspondence problem between all 3D points on the object for all video frames, including frames where some points are invisible. To achieve that, the estimation is driven by re-rendering the input video frames as well as possible through differentiable rendering, which has not been used for tracking before. The proposed optimization minimizes a novel loss function to estimate the best 3D shape, texture, and 6DoF pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in 2D segmentation tracking on three different datasets with mostly rigid objects.

In this paper, we propose ARKitTrack, a new RGB-D tracking dataset for both static and dynamic scenes captured by consumer-grade LiDAR scanners equipped on Apple's iPhone and iPad. ARKitTrack contains 300 RGB-D sequences, 455 targets, and 229.7K video frames in total. Along with the bounding box annotations and frame-level attributes, we also annotate this dataset with 123.9K pixel-level target masks. Besides, the camera intrinsic and camera pose of each frame are provided for future developments. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of this dataset, we further present a unified baseline for both box-level and pixel-level tracking, which integrates RGB features with bird's-eye-view representations to better explore cross-modality 3D geometry. In-depth empirical analysis has verified that the ARKitTrack dataset can significantly facilitate RGB-D tracking and that the proposed baseline method compares favorably against the state of the arts.

In this paper, we propose a Variational Neural Network-based version of a Voxel Pseudo Image Tracking (VPIT) method for 3D Single Object Tracking. The Variational Feature Generation Network of the proposed Variational VPIT computes features for target and search regions and the corresponding uncertainties, which are later combined using an uncertainty-aware cross-correlation module in one of two ways: by computing similarity between the corresponding uncertainties and adding it to the regular cross-correlation values, or by penalizing the uncertain feature channels to increase influence of the certain features. In experiments, we show that both methods improve tracking performance, while penalization of uncertain features provides the best uncertainty quality.

The solutions to these problems are generally based on their respective assumptions, \ie{the static world assumption for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose assumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to hold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely correlated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This method integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the stationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to potentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using the filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based object association method that accurately associates objects according to the historical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the stationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based collaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently restored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph is implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and object tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object tracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the robustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.

Indeed, we propose a new real-time Depth Perspective-aware Multiple Object Tracking (DP-MOT) approach to tackle the occlusion problem in MOT. A simple yet efficient Subject-Ordered Depth Estimation (SODE) is first proposed to automatically order the depth positions of detected subjects in a 2D scene in an unsupervised manner. Using the output from SODE, a new Active pseudo-3D Kalman filter, a simple but effective extension of Kalman filter with dynamic control variables, is then proposed to dynamically update the movement of objects. In addition, a new high-order association approach is presented in the data association step to incorporate first-order and second-order relationships between the detected objects. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to recent MOT methods on standard MOT benchmarks.

VPIT is the first method that uses voxel pseudo images for 3D SOT. The input point cloud is structured by pillar-based voxelization, and the resulting pseudo image is used as an input to a 2D-like Siamese SOT method. The pseudo image is created in the Bird's-eye View (BEV) coordinates, and therefore the objects in it have constant size. Thus, only the object rotation can change in the new coordinate system and not the object scale. For this reason, we replace multi-scale search with a multi-rotation search, where differently rotated search regions are compared against a single target representation to predict both position and rotation of the object. Experiments on KITTI Tracking dataset show that VPIT is the fastest 3D SOT method and maintains competitive Success and Precision values. Application of a SOT method in a real-world scenario meets with limitations such as lower computational capabilities of embedded devices and a latency-unforgiving environment, where the method is forced to skip certain data frames if the inference speed is not high enough. We implement a real-time evaluation protocol and show that other methods lose most of their performance on embedded devices, while VPIT maintains its ability to track the object.

Unlike other computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, re-identification, and segmentation, embedding methods in MOT have large variations, and they have never been systematically analyzed and summarized. In this survey, we first conduct a comprehensive overview with in-depth analysis for embedding methods in MOT from seven different perspectives, including patch-level embedding, single-frame embedding, cross-frame joint embedding, correlation embedding, sequential embedding, tracklet embedding, and cross-track relational embedding. We further summarize the existing widely used MOT datasets and analyze the advantages of existing state-of-the-art methods according to their embedding strategies.

LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.

However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.

Meanwhile, Radar-based solutions remain robust but often suffer from limited vertical resolution and simplistic motion models. Existing Kalman filter-based approaches also rely on fixed noise covariance, hampering adaptability when objects make sudden maneuvers. We propose Bayes-4DRTrack, a 4D Radar-based MOT framework that adopts a transformer-based motion prediction network to capture nonlinear motion dynamics and employs Bayesian approximation in both detection and prediction steps. Moreover, our two-stage data association leverages Doppler measurements to better distinguish closely spaced targets. Evaluated on the K-Radar dataset (including adverse weather scenarios), Bayes-4DRTrack demonstrates a 5.7% gain in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) over methods with traditional motion models and fixed noise covariance. These results showcase enhanced robustness and accuracy in demanding, real-world conditions.

They typically capture context by incorporating multiple video frames. However, these naive frame-context methods fail to consider the importance of each patch within a reference frame, making them susceptible to noise and redundant tokens, which deteriorates tracking performance. To address this challenge, we propose a new token context-aware tracking pipeline named LMTrack, designed to automatically learn high-quality reference tokens for efficient visual tracking. Embracing the principle of Less is More, the core idea of LMTrack is to analyze the importance distribution of all reference tokens, where important tokens are collected, continually attended to, and updated. Specifically, a novel Token Context Memory module is designed to dynamically collect high-quality spatio-temporal information of a target in an autoregressive manner, eliminating redundant background tokens from the reference frames. Furthermore, an effective Unidirectional Token Attention mechanism is designed to establish dependencies between reference tokens and search frame, enabling robust cross-frame association and target localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our tracker, achieving state-of-the-art results on tracking benchmarks such as GOT-10K, TrackingNet, and LaSOT.

However, the context length constructed by existing work is limited, only considering object information from adjacent frames or video clips, leading to insufficient utilization of contextual information. To address this issue, we propose MambaLCT, which constructs and utilizes target variation cues from the first frame to the current frame for robust tracking. First, a novel unidirectional Context Mamba module is designed to scan frame features along the temporal dimension, gathering target change cues throughout the entire sequence. Specifically, target-related information in frame features is compressed into a hidden state space through selective scanning mechanism. The target information across the entire video is continuously aggregated into target variation cues. Next, we inject the target change cues into the attention mechanism, providing temporal information for modeling the relationship between the template and search frames. The advantage of MambaLCT is its ability to continuously extend the length of the context, capturing complete target change cues, which enhances the stability and robustness of the tracker. Extensive experiments show that long-term context information enhances the model's ability to perceive targets in complex scenarios. MambaLCT achieves new SOTA performance on six benchmarks while maintaining real-time running speeds.

Recent studies have begun to explore representations learned in large generative image models for semantic correspondence, demonstrating promising results. Building on this progress, current state-of-the-art methods rely on combining multiple large models, resulting in high computational demands and reduced efficiency. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a more computationally efficient approach. We propose a novel knowledge distillation technique to overcome the problem of reduced efficiency. We show how to use two large vision foundation models and distill the capabilities of these complementary models into one smaller model that maintains high accuracy at reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by incorporating 3D data, we are able to further improve performance, without the need for human-annotated correspondences. Overall, our empirical results demonstrate that our distilled model with 3D data augmentation achieves performance superior to current state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational load and enhancing practicality for real-world applications, such as semantic video correspondence.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Amodal-Aware Video Instance Segmentation (A2VIS), which incorporates amodal representations to achieve a reliable and comprehensive understanding of both visible and occluded parts of objects in a video. The key intuition is that awareness of amodal segmentation through spatiotemporal dimension enables a stable stream of object information. In scenarios where objects are partially or completely hidden from view, amodal segmentation offers more consistency and less dramatic changes along the temporal axis compared to visible segmentation. Hence, both amodal and visible information from all clips can be integrated into one global instance prototype. To effectively address the challenge of video amodal segmentation, we introduce the spatiotemporal-prior Amodal Mask Head, which leverages visible information intra clips while extracting amodal characteristics inter clips. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that A2VIS excels in both MOT and VIS tasks in identifying and tracking object instances with a keen understanding of their full shape.

In this paper, we reconsidered the deficiencies in the current approaches to initializing single object trackers and propose a new paradigm for single object tracking algorithms, ClickTrack, a new paradigm using clicking interaction for real-time scenarios. Moreover, click as an input type inherently lack hierarchical information. To address ambiguity in certain special scenarios, we designed the Guided Click Refiner(GCR), which accepts point and optional textual information as inputs, transforming the point into the bounding box expected by the operator. The bounding box will be used as input of single object trackers. Experiments on LaSOT and GOT-10k benchmarks show that tracker combined with GCR achieves stable performance in real-time interactive scenarios. Furthermore, we explored the integration of GCR into the Segment Anything model(SAM), significantly reducing ambiguity issues when SAM receives point inputs.

Automated data driven metrics can alleviate these difficulties, as demonstrated by existing machine learning instrument tracking models in minimally invasive surgery. However, these models have been tested on limited datasets of laparoscopic surgery, with a focus on isolated tasks and robotic surgery. In this paper, a new public dataset is introduced, focusing on simulated surgery, using the nasal phase of endoscopic pituitary surgery as an exemplar. Simulated surgery allows for a realistic yet repeatable environment, meaning the insights gained from automated assessment can be used by novice surgeons to hone their skills on the simulator before moving to real surgery. PRINTNet (Pituitary Real-time INstrument Tracking Network) has been created as a baseline model for this automated assessment. Consisting of DeepLabV3 for classification and segmentation; StrongSORT for tracking; and the NVIDIA Holoscan SDK for real-time performance, PRINTNet achieved 71.9% Multiple Object Tracking Precision running at 22 Frames Per Second. Using this tracking output, a Multilayer Perceptron achieved 87% accuracy in predicting surgical skill level (novice or expert), with the "ratio of total procedure time to instrument visible time" correlated with higher surgical skill. This therefore demonstrates the feasibility of automated surgical skill assessment in simulated endoscopic pituitary surgery.

The surge in aerial video data necessitates accurate prediction for future scenarios and motion states of the interested target, particularly in applications like traffic management and disaster response. Existing video prediction methods focus solely on predicting future scenes (video frames), suffering from the neglect of explicitly modeling target's motion states, which is crucial for aerial video interpretation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel task called Target-Aware Aerial Video Prediction, aiming to simultaneously predict future scenes and motion states of the target. Further, we design a model specifically for this task, named TAFormer, which provides a unified modeling approach for both video and target motion states. Specifically, we introduce Spatiotemporal Attention (STA), which decouples the learning of video dynamics into spatial static attention and temporal dynamic attention, effectively modeling the scene appearance and motion. Additionally, we design an Information Sharing Mechanism (ISM), which elegantly unifies the modeling of video and target motion by facilitating information interaction through two sets of messenger tokens. Moreover, to alleviate the difficulty of distinguishing targets in blurry predictions, we introduce Target-Sensitive Gaussian Loss (TSGL), enhancing the model's sensitivity to both target's position and content. Extensive experiments on UAV123VP and VisDroneVP (derived from single-object tracking datasets) demonstrate the exceptional performance of TAFormer in target-aware video prediction, showcasing its adaptability to the additional requirements of aerial video interpretation for target awareness.

Inspired by the success of the spike camera, we proposed Spike-NeRF, the first Neural Radiance Field derived from spike data, to achieve 3D reconstruction and novel viewpoint synthesis of high-speed scenes. Instead of the multi-view images at the same time of NeRF, the inputs of Spike-NeRF are continuous spike streams captured by a moving spike camera in a very short time. To reconstruct a correct and stable 3D scene from high-frequency but unstable spike data, we devised spike masks along with a distinctive loss function. We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic scenes generated by blender with the spike camera simulator. Our results demonstrate that Spike-NeRF produces more visually appealing results than the existing methods and the baseline we proposed in high-speed scenes. Our code and data will be released soon.

Most methods that solely depend on coarse-grained object cues, such as boxes and the overall appearance of the object, are susceptible to degradation due to distorted internal relationships of dynamic objects. To address this problem, this work proposes NetTrack, an efficient, generic, and affordable tracking framework to introduce fine-grained learning that is robust to dynamicity. Specifically, NetTrack constructs a dynamicity-aware association with a fine-grained Net, leveraging point-level visual cues. Correspondingly, a fine-grained sampler and matching method have been incorporated. Furthermore, NetTrack learns object-text correspondence for fine-grained localization. To evaluate MOT in extremely dynamic open-world scenarios, a bird flock tracking (BFT) dataset is constructed, which exhibits high dynamicity with diverse species and open-world scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation on BFT validates the effectiveness of fine-grained learning on object dynamicity, and thorough transfer experiments on challenging open-world benchmarks, i.e., TAO, TAO-OW, AnimalTrack, and GMOT-40, validate the strong generalization ability of NetTrack even without finetuning.

We also propose an attention-based visual feature module to fuse the hierarchical visual representations. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and time efficiency among query-based methods on multiple multi-object tracking benchmarks.

The scalar-valued edges in these graphs often lead to a loss of information and thereby to limitations in terms of expressiveness. For example, oftentimes high-dimensional data (e.g. feature descriptors) are mapped to a single scalar value (e.g. the similarity between two feature descriptors). To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel formalism for non-separable multi-dimensional network flows. By doing so, we enable an automatic and adaptive feature selection strategy - since the flow is defined on a per-dimension basis, the maximizing flow automatically chooses the best matching feature dimensions. As a proof of concept, we apply our formalism to the multi-object tracking problem and demonstrate that our approach outperforms scalar formulations on the MOT16 benchmark in terms of robustness to noise.

The majority of siamese network based trackers now in use treat each channel in the feature maps generated by the backbone network equally, making the similarity response map sensitive to background influence and hence challenging to focus on the target region. Additionally, there are no structural links between the classification and regression branches in these trackers, and the two branches are optimized separately during training. Therefore, there is a misalignment between the classification and regression branches, which results in less accurate tracking results. In this paper, a Target Highlight Module is proposed to help the generated similarity response maps to be more focused on the target region. To reduce the misalignment and produce more precise tracking results, we propose a corrective loss to train the model. The two branches of the model are jointly tuned with the use of corrective loss to produce more reliable prediction results. Experiments on 5 challenging benchmark datasets reveal that the method outperforms current models in terms of performance, and runs at 38 fps, proving its effectiveness and efficiency.

To train an object detector with satisfactory accuracy, a large amount of data is required. However, due to the intensive workforce involved with annotating large datasets, such a data curation task is often outsourced to a third party or relied on volunteers. This work reveals severe vulnerabilities of such data curation pipeline. We propose MACAB that crafts clean-annotated images to stealthily implant the backdoor into the object detectors trained on them even when the data curator can manually audit the images. We observe that the backdoor effect of both misclassification and the cloaking are robustly achieved in the wild when the backdoor is activated with inconspicuously natural physical triggers. Backdooring non-classification object detection with clean-annotation is challenging compared to backdooring existing image classification tasks with clean-label, owing to the complexity of having multiple objects within each frame, including victim and non-victim objects. The efficacy of the MACAB is ensured by constructively i abusing the image-scaling function used by the deep learning framework, ii incorporating the proposed adversarial clean image replica technique, and iii combining poison data selection criteria given constrained attacking budget. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MACAB exhibits more than 90% attack success rate under various real-world scenes. This includes both cloaking and misclassification backdoor effect even restricted with a small attack budget. The poisoned samples cannot be effectively identified by state-of-the-art detection techniques.The comprehensive video demo is at https://youtu.be/MA7L_LpXkp4, which is based on a poison rate of 0.14% for YOLOv4 cloaking backdoor and Faster R-CNN misclassification backdoor.

Furthermore, we show (theoretically and empirically in several examples) that our method outperforms non-predictor corrector methods that do not exploit the underlying continuous process.

While isometries are often studied in shape correspondence problems, they have not been considered explicitly in the multi-matching setting. This paper closes this gap by proposing a novel optimisation formulation for isometric multi-shape matching. We present a suitable optimisation algorithm for solving our formulation and provide a convergence and complexity analysis. Our algorithm obtains multi-matchings that are by construction provably cycle-consistent. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method on various datasets and set the new state-of-the-art in isometric multi-shape matching.

Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU) benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of 2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and robotic applications.

Previous MLLM-based methods commonly struggle with the dilemma between "Ref" and "VOS": they either specialize in understanding a few key frames (global reasoning) or tracking objects on continuous frames (local reasoning), and rely on external VOS or frame selectors to mitigate the other end of the challenge. However, our framework GLUS shows that global and local consistency can be unified into a single video segmentation MLLM: a set of sparse "context frames" provides global information, while a stream of continuous "query frames" conducts local object tracking. This is further supported by jointly training the MLLM with a pre-trained VOS memory bank to simultaneously digest short-range and long-range temporal information. To improve the information efficiency within the limited context window of MLLMs, we introduce object contrastive learning to distinguish hard false-positive objects and a self-refined framework to identify crucial frames and perform propagation. By collectively integrating these insights, our GLUS delivers a simple yet effective baseline, achieving new state-of-the-art for MLLMs on the MeViS and Ref-Youtube-VOS benchmark.

This provides robots with a spatio-temporal understanding of the environment, an essential attribute for their operation in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for panoptic tracking that simultaneously captures general semantic information and instance-specific appearance and motion features. Unlike existing methods that overlook dynamic scene attributes, our approach leverages both appearance and motion cues through dedicated network heads. These interconnected heads employ multi-scale deformable convolutions that reason about scene motion offsets with semantic context and motion-enhanced appearance features to learn tracking embeddings. Furthermore, we introduce a novel two-step fusion module that integrates the outputs from both heads by first matching instances from the current time step with propagated instances from previous time steps and subsequently refines associations using motion-enhanced appearance embeddings, improving robustness in challenging scenarios. Extensive evaluations of our proposed \netname model on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoptic tracking accuracy, surpassing prior methods in maintaining object identities over time.

Although recent deep learning frameworks like TrackNetV1, V2, and V3 have advanced tennis ball and shuttlecock tracking, they often struggle in scenarios with partial occlusion or low visibility. This is primarily because these models rely heavily on visual features without explicitly incorporating motion information, which is crucial for precise tracking and trajectory prediction. In this paper, we introduce an enhancement to the TrackNet family by fusing high-level visual features with learnable motion attention maps through a motion-aware fusion mechanism, effectively emphasizing the moving ball's location and improving tracking performance. Our approach leverages frame differencing maps, modulated by a motion prompt layer, to highlight key motion regions over time. Experimental results on the tennis ball and shuttlecock datasets show that our method enhances the tracking performance of both TrackNetV2 and V3. We refer to our lightweight, plug-and-play solution, built on top of the existing TrackNet, as TrackNetV4.

In this paper, we propose an intriguing question: May we learn from multiple modalities only during training to avoid multi-modal input in the inference phase? To answer it, we propose \textbf{YOLOO}, a novel multi-modal 3D MOT paradigm: You Only Learn from Others Once. YOLOO empowers the point cloud encoder to learn a unified tri-modal representation (UTR) from point clouds and other modalities, such as images and textual cues, all at once. Leveraging this UTR, YOLOO achieves efficient tracking solely using the point cloud encoder without compromising its performance, fundamentally obviating the need for computationally intensive DNNs. Specifically, YOLOO includes two core components: a unified tri-modal encoder (UTEnc) and a flexible geometric constraint (F-GC) module. UTEnc integrates a point cloud encoder with image and text encoders adapted from pre-trained CLIP. It seamlessly fuses point cloud information with rich visual-textual knowledge from CLIP into the point cloud encoder, yielding highly discriminative UTRs that facilitate the association between trajectories and detections. Additionally, F-GC filters out mismatched associations with similar representations but significant positional discrepancies. It further enhances the robustness of UTRs without requiring any scene-specific tuning, addressing a key limitation of customized geometric constraints (e.g., 3D IoU). Lastly, high-quality 3D trajectories are generated by a traditional data association component. By integrating these advancements into a multi-modal 3D MOT scheme, our YOLOO achieves substantial gains in both robustness and efficiency.

However, this is a challenge due the presence of occlusions. Multi-view perception approaches allow robots to overcome occlusions, but a tracking component is needed to associate the objects detected by the robot over multiple viewpoints. Multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms can be categorized between two-stage and single-stage methods. Two-stage methods tend to be simpler to adapt and implement to custom applications, while single-stage methods present a more complex end-to-end tracking method that can yield better results in occluded situations at the cost of more training data. The potential advantages of single-stage methods over two-stage methods depends on the complexity of the sequence of viewpoints that a robot needs to process. In this work, we compare a 3D two-stage MOT algorithm, 3D-SORT, against a 3D single-stage MOT algorithm, MOT-DETR, in three different types of sequences with varying levels of complexity. The sequences represent simpler and more complex motions that a robot arm can perform in a tomato greenhouse. Our experiments in a tomato greenhouse show that the single-stage algorithm consistently yields better tracking accuracy, especially in the more challenging sequences where objects are fully occluded or non-visible during several viewpoints.

Existing 3D SOT methods typically adhere to a point-based processing pipeline, wherein the re-sampling operation invariably leads to either redundant or missing information, thereby impacting performance. To address these issues, we propose PillarTrack, a novel pillar-based 3D SOT framework. First, we transform sparse point clouds into dense pillars to preserve the local and global geometrics. Second, we propose a Pyramid-Encoded Pillar Feature Encoder (PE-PFE) design to enhance the robustness of pillar feature for translation/rotation/scale. Third, we present an efficient Transformer-based backbone from the perspective of modality differences. Finally, we construct our PillarTrack based on above designs. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves comparable performance on the KITTI and NuScenes datasets, significantly enhancing the performance of the baseline.

Classical trackers rely solely on visual cues, restricting their ability to handle challenges such as appearance variations, ambiguity, and distractions. Hence, Vision-Language (VL) tracking has emerged as a promising approach, incorporating language descriptions to directly provide high-level semantics and enhance tracking performance. However, current VL trackers have not fully exploited the power of VL learning, as they suffer from limitations such as heavily relying on off-the-shelf backbones for feature extraction, ineffective VL fusion designs, and the absence of VL-related loss functions. Consequently, we present a novel tracker that progressively explores target-centric semantics for VL tracking. Specifically, we propose the first Synchronous Learning Backbone (SLB) for VL tracking, which consists of two novel modules: the Target Enhance Module (TEM) and the Semantic Aware Module (SAM). These modules enable the tracker to perceive target-related semantics and comprehend the context of both visual and textual modalities at the same pace, facilitating VL feature extraction and fusion at different semantic levels. Moreover, we devise the dense matching loss to further strengthen multi-modal representation learning. Extensive experiments on VL tracking datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our methods.

  However, MOT for the videos captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is still challenging due to small object size, blurred object appearance, and very large and/or irregular motion in both ground objects and UAV platforms.
  In this paper, we propose FOLT to mitigate these problems and reach fast and accurate MOT in UAV view.
  Aiming at speed-accuracy trade-off, FOLT adopts a modern detector and light-weight optical flow extractor to extract object detection features and motion features at a minimum cost.
  Given the extracted flow, the flow-guided feature augmentation is designed to augment the object detection feature based on its optical flow, which improves the detection of small objects.
  Then the flow-guided motion prediction is also proposed to predict the object's position in the next frame, which improves the tracking performance of objects with very large displacements between adjacent frames.
  Finally, the tracker matches the detected objects and predicted objects using a spatially matching scheme to generate tracks for every object.
  Experiments on Visdrone and UAVDT datasets show that our proposed model can successfully track small objects with large and irregular motion and outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in UAV-MOT tasks.

However, agro-food environments pose difficulties for robots due to high variation and occlusions. In the presence of these challenges, accurate world models, with information about object location, shape, and properties, are crucial for robots to perform tasks accurately. Building such models is challenging due to the complex and unique nature of agro-food environments, and errors in the model can lead to task execution issues. In this paper, MinkSORT, a novel method for generating tracking features using a 3D sparse convolutional network in a deepSORT-like approach, is proposed to improve the accuracy of world models in agro-food environments. MinkSORT was evaluated using real-world data collected in a tomato greenhouse, where it significantly improved the performance of a baseline model that tracks tomato positions in 3D using a Kalman filter and Mahalanobis distance. MinkSORT improved the HOTA from 42.8% to 44.77%, the association accuracy from 32.55% to 35.55%, and the MOTA from 57.63% to 58.81%. Different contrastive loss functions for training MinkSORT were also evaluated, and it was demonstrated that it leads to improved performance in terms of three separate precision and recall detection outcomes. The proposed method improves world model accuracy, enabling robots to perform tasks such as harvesting and plant maintenance with greater efficiency and accuracy, which is essential for meeting the growing demand for food in a sustainable manner.

Yet, traditional multiple object tracking (MOT) benchmarks rely only on a few object categories that hardly represent the multitude of possible objects that are encountered in the real world. This leaves contemporary MOT methods limited to a small set of pre-defined object categories. In this paper, we address this limitation by tackling a novel task, open-vocabulary MOT, that aims to evaluate tracking beyond pre-defined training categories. We further develop OVTrack, an open-vocabulary tracker that is capable of tracking arbitrary object classes. Its design is based on two key ingredients: First, leveraging vision-language models for both classification and association via knowledge distillation; second, a data hallucination strategy for robust appearance feature learning from denoising diffusion probabilistic models. The result is an extremely data-efficient open-vocabulary tracker that sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale, large-vocabulary TAO benchmark, while being trained solely on static images.

Despite its wide-ranging use, this task remains challenging due to the significant appearance variation caused by occlusion and size differences among tracked targets. To address these issues, we present MBPTrack, which adopts a Memory mechanism to utilize past information and formulates localization in a coarse-to-fine scheme using Box Priors given in the first frame. Specifically, past frames with targetness masks serve as an external memory, and a transformer-based module propagates tracked target cues from the memory to the current frame. To precisely localize objects of all sizes, MBPTrack first predicts the target center via Hough voting. By leveraging box priors given in the first frame, we adaptively sample reference points around the target center that roughly cover the target of different sizes. Then, we obtain dense feature maps by aggregating point features into the reference points, where localization can be performed more effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, while running at 50 FPS on a single RTX3090 GPU.

It remains a challenging problem due to the large appearance variation and the sparsity of points caused by occlusion and limited sensor capabilities. Therefore, contextual information across two consecutive frames is crucial for effective object tracking. However, points containing such useful information are often overlooked and cropped out in existing methods, leading to insufficient use of important contextual knowledge. To address this issue, we propose CXTrack, a novel transformer-based network for 3D object tracking, which exploits ConteXtual information to improve the tracking results. Specifically, we design a target-centric transformer network that directly takes point features from two consecutive frames and the previous bounding box as input to explore contextual information and implicitly propagate target cues. To achieve accurate localization for objects of all sizes, we propose a transformer-based localization head with a novel center embedding module to distinguish the target from distractors. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, show that CXTrack achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance while running at 34 FPS.

Traditional approaches, where robots simply capture an image, process that image to take an action, and then forget the information, have proven to struggle in the presence of occlusions. Methods using multi-view perception, which have the potential to address some of these problems, require a world model that guides the collection, integration and extraction of information from multiple viewpoints. Furthermore, constructing a generic representation that can be applied in various environments and tasks is a difficult challenge. In this paper, a novel approach for building generic representations in occluded agro-food environments using multi-view perception and 3D multi-object tracking is introduced. The method is based on a detection algorithm that generates partial point clouds for each detected object, followed by a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm that updates the representation over time. The accuracy of the representation was evaluated in a real-world environment, where successful representation and localisation of tomatoes in tomato plants were achieved, despite high levels of occlusion, with the total count of tomatoes estimated with a maximum error of 5.08% and the tomatoes tracked with an accuracy up to 71.47%. Novel tracking metrics were introduced, demonstrating that valuable insight into the errors in localising and representing the fruits can be provided by their use. This approach presents a novel solution for building representations in occluded agro-food environments, demonstrating potential to enable robots to perform tasks effectively in these challenging environments.

In this context, neuromarketing seeks to enhance the promotion of products and generate a greater acceptance on potential buyers. Traditionally, neuromarketing studies have relied on a single biosignal to obtain feedback from presented stimuli. However, thanks to new devices and technological advances studying this area of knowledge, recent trends indicate a shift towards the fusion of diverse biosignals. An example is the usage of electroencephalography for understanding the impact of an advertisement at the neural level and visual tracking to identify the stimuli that induce such impacts. This emerging pattern determines which biosignals to employ for achieving specific neuromarketing objectives. Furthermore, the fusion of data from multiple sources demands advanced processing methodologies. Despite these complexities, there is a lack of literature that adequately collates and organizes the various data sources and the applied processing techniques for the research objectives pursued. To address these challenges, the current paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the objectives, biosignals, and data processing techniques employed in neuromarketing research. This study provides both the technical definition and a graphical distribution of the elements under revision. Additionally, it presents a categorization based on research objectives and provides an overview of the combinatory methodologies employed. After this, the paper examines primary public datasets designed for neuromarketing research together with others whose main purpose is not neuromarketing, but can be used for this matter. Ultimately, this work provides a historical perspective on the evolution of techniques across various phases over recent years and enumerates key lessons learned.

However, recent developments still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain, particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field angular-temporal modeling.

Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive - a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17.81fps for HD and 7.53fps on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200K+ annotated animal instances across 19K+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our multi-animal tracking experiments with onboard hardware confirm that near real-time high-resolution wildlife tracking is possible on UAVs whilst maintaining high accuracy levels as needed for future navigational and mission-specific animal-centric operational autonomy.

This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments. We hope this survey serves as a reference, facilitating the adoption of event-based vision across diverse applications.

A Fine-grained Evaluation to Reveal the Role of Language in Vision-Language Tracking</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>Vision-language tracking (VLT) extends traditional single object tracking by incorporating textual information, providing semantic guidance to enhance tracking performance under challenging conditions like fast motion and deformations. However, current VLT trackers often underperform compared to single-modality methods on multiple benchmarks, with semantic information sometimes becoming a "distraction." To address this, we propose VLTVerse, the first fine-grained evaluation framework for VLT trackers that comprehensively considers multiple challenge factors and diverse semantic information, hoping to reveal the role of language in VLT. Our contributions include: (1) VLTVerse introduces 10 sequence-level challenge labels and 6 types of multi-granularity semantic information, creating a flexible and multi-dimensional evaluation space for VLT; (2) leveraging 60 subspaces formed by combinations of challenge factors and semantic types, we conduct systematic fine-grained evaluations of three mainstream SOTA VLT trackers, uncovering their performance bottlenecks across complex scenarios and offering a novel perspective on VLT evaluation; (3) through decoupled analysis of experimental results, we examine the impact of various semantic types on specific challenge factors in relation to different algorithms, providing essential guidance for enhancing VLT across data, evaluation, and algorithmic dimensions. The VLTVerse, toolkit, and results will be available at \url{http://metaverse.aitestunion.com}.

Despite this, most VLT benchmarks still depend on succinct, human-annotated text descriptions for each video. These descriptions often fall short in capturing the nuances of video content dynamics and lack stylistic variety in language, constrained by their uniform level of detail and a fixed annotation frequency. As a result, algorithms tend to default to a "memorize the answer" strategy, diverging from the core objective of achieving a deeper understanding of video content. Fortunately, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of diverse text. This work utilizes LLMs to generate varied semantic annotations (in terms of text lengths and granularities) for representative SOT benchmarks, thereby establishing a novel multi-modal benchmark. Specifically, we (1) propose a new visual language tracking benchmark with diverse texts, named DTVLT, based on five prominent VLT and SOT benchmarks, including three sub-tasks: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance tracking. (2) We offer four granularity texts in our benchmark, considering the extent and density of semantic information. We expect this multi-granular generation strategy to foster a favorable environment for VLT and video understanding research. (3) We conduct comprehensive experimental analyses on DTVLT, evaluating the impact of diverse text on tracking performance and hope the identified performance bottlenecks of existing algorithms can support further research in VLT and video understanding. The proposed benchmark, experimental results and toolkit will be released gradually on http://videocube.aitestunion.com/.

By leveraging high-level semantic information, VLT guides object tracking, alleviating the constraints associated with relying on a visual modality. Nevertheless, most VLT benchmarks are annotated in a single granularity and lack a coherent semantic framework to provide scientific guidance. Moreover, coordinating human annotators for high-quality annotations is laborious and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce DTLLM-VLT, which automatically generates extensive and multi-granularity text to enhance environmental diversity. (1) DTLLM-VLT generates scientific and multi-granularity text descriptions using a cohesive prompt framework. Its succinct and highly adaptable design allows seamless integration into various visual tracking benchmarks. (2) We select three prominent benchmarks to deploy our approach: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance tracking. We offer four granularity combinations for these benchmarks, considering the extent and density of semantic information, thereby showcasing the practicality and versatility of DTLLM-VLT. (3) We conduct comparative experiments on VLT benchmarks with different text granularities, evaluating and analyzing the impact of diverse text on tracking performance. Conclusionally, this work leverages LLM to provide multi-granularity semantic information for VLT task from efficient and diverse perspectives, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers. In the future, we believe this work can be extended to more datasets to support vision datasets understanding.

However, relying solely on deep learning models to obtain better tracking results requires carefully selecting feature information that is beneficial to representing the target object and designing a reasonable template update strategy, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty of model design. Thus, recent TIR tracking methods face many challenges in complex scenarios. This paper introduces a novel Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) method to enhance TIR tracking in these challenging situations. DBF is distinctive in its dual-model structure: the system and observation models. The system model leverages motion data to estimate the potential positions of the target object based on two-dimensional Brownian motion, thus generating a prior probability. Following this, the observation model comes into play upon capturing the TIR image. It serves as a classifier and employs infrared information to ascertain the likelihood of these estimated positions, creating a likelihood probability. According to the guidance of the two models, the position of the target object can be determined, and the template can be dynamically updated. Experimental analysis across several benchmark datasets reveals that DBF achieves competitive performance, surpassing most existing TIR tracking methods in complex scenarios.

While there have been numerous studies aimed at enhancing algorithm efficiency, most of them focus on the batch problem, where all the data must be available simultaneously to construct a static graph. However, with the growing number of applications that generate streaming data, an efficient online algorithm is required to handle the streaming nature of the input. In this paper, we present an online extension of the well-known negative cycle canceling algorithm for solving the multi-object tracking problem with streaming fragmented data. We provide a proof of correctness for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency through numerical experiments.

Yet, challenges persist, including generalization across scenarios, maintaining reliability, and ensuring real-time responsiveness. This paper introduces a perception framework grounded in foundation models for universal object detection and tracking, moving beyond specific training categories. Integral to our approach is a multi-layered tracker integrated with the foundation detector, ensuring continuous target visibility, even when faced with motion blur, abrupt light shifts, and occlusions. Complementing this, we introduce a model-free controller tailored for resilient quadrotor visual tracking. Our system operates efficiently on limited hardware, relying solely on an onboard camera and an inertial measurement unit. Through extensive validation in diverse challenging indoor and outdoor environments, we demonstrate our system's effectiveness and adaptability. In conclusion, our research represents a step forward in quadrotor visual tracking, moving from task-specific methods to more versatile and adaptable operations.

However, the recent success of online methods questions this belief, in particular, for challenging and long video sequences. We understand this work as a rebuttal of those recent observations and an appeal to the community to focus on dedicated near-online VIS approaches. To support our argument, we present a detailed analysis on different processing paradigms and the new end-to-end trainable NOVIS (Near-Online Video Instance Segmentation) method. Our transformer-based model directly predicts spatio-temporal mask volumes for clips of frames and performs instance tracking between clips via overlap embeddings. NOVIS represents the first near-online VIS approach which avoids any handcrafted tracking heuristics. We outperform all existing VIS methods by large margins and provide new state-of-the-art results on both YouTube-VIS (2019/2021) and the OVIS benchmarks.

For example, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is an important technique that lays the foundation for many common tasks, such as navigation and long-term object tracking. This entails building a map on the go based on sensory inputs which are prone to accumulating errors. Recognizing landmarks in the environment plays a vital role in correcting these errors and further improving the accuracy of SLAM. The most popular choice of sensors for conducting SLAM today is optical sensors such as cameras or LiDAR sensors. These can use landmarks such as QR codes as a prerequisite. However, such sensors become unreliable in certain conditions, e.g., foggy, dusty, reflective, or glass-rich environments. Sonar has proven to be a viable alternative to manage such situations better. However, acoustic sensors also require a different type of landmark. In this paper, we put forward a method to detect the presence of bio-mimetic acoustic landmarks using support vector machines trained on the frequency bands of the reflecting acoustic echoes using an embedded real-time imaging sonar.

However, previous Siamese-based trackers overlook the negative effects brought by randomly dropped object points during backbone sampling, which hinder trackers to predict accurate bounding boxes (BBoxes). Exploring an approach that seeks to maximize the preservation of object points and their object-aware features is of particular significance. Motivated by this, we propose an Object Preserving Siamese Network
  (OPSNet), which can significantly maintain object integrity and boost tracking performance. Firstly, the object highlighting module enhances the object-aware features and extracts discriminative features from template and search area. Then, the object-preserved sampling selects object candidates to obtain object-preserved search area seeds and drop the background points that contribute less to tracking. Finally, the object localization network precisely locates 3D BBoxes based on the object-preserved search area seeds. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance (9.4% and 2.5% success gain on KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset respectively).

While the task has received much attention in the last decades, researchers have almost exclusively focused on the single object setting. Multi-object GOT benefits from a wider applicability, rendering it more attractive in real-world applications. We attribute the lack of research interest into this problem to the absence of suitable benchmarks. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale GOT benchmark, LaGOT, containing multiple annotated target objects per sequence. Our benchmark allows users to tackle key remaining challenges in GOT, aiming to increase robustness and reduce computation through joint tracking of multiple objects simultaneously. In addition, we propose a transformer-based GOT tracker baseline capable of joint processing of multiple objects through shared computation. Our approach achieves a 4x faster run-time in case of 10 concurrent objects compared to tracking each object independently and outperforms existing single object trackers on our new benchmark. In addition, our approach achieves highly competitive results on single-object GOT datasets, setting a new state of the art on TrackingNet with a success rate AUC of 84.4%. Our benchmark, code, and trained models will be made publicly available.

The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed, including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is, in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better model-based algorithms in future developments.

In particular, one quasi-metric is an extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.

Its task form is to guide the models to track the objects that conform to the language instruction. However, the RMOT task commonly requires clear language instructions, such methods often fail to work when complex language instructions with reasoning characteristics appear. In this work, we propose a new task, called Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT). ReaMOT is a more challenging task that requires accurate reasoning about objects that match the language instruction with reasoning characteristic and tracking the objects' trajectories. To advance the ReaMOT task and evaluate the reasoning capabilities of tracking models, we construct ReaMOT Challenge, a reasoning-based multi-object tracking benchmark built upon 12 datasets. Specifically, it comprises 1,156 language instructions with reasoning characteristic, 423,359 image-language pairs, and 869 diverse scenes, which is divided into three levels of reasoning difficulty. In addition, we propose a set of evaluation metrics tailored for the ReaMOT task. Furthermore, we propose ReaTrack, a training-free framework for reasoning-based multi-object tracking based on large vision-language models (LVLM) and SAM2, as a baseline for the ReaMOT task. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.

Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data. Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.

The primary challenge in next-frame prediction lies in effectively capturing and processing both spatial and temporal information from previous video sequences. The transformer architecture, known for its prowess in handling sequence data, has made remarkable progress in this domain. However, transformer-based next-frame prediction models face notable issues: (a) The multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism requires the input embedding to be split into $N$ chunks, where $N$ is the number of heads. Each segment captures only a fraction of the original embeddings information, which distorts the representation of the embedding in the latent space, resulting in a semantic dilution problem; (b) These models predict the embeddings of the next frames rather than the frames themselves, but the loss function based on the errors of the reconstructed frames, not the predicted embeddings -- this creates a discrepancy between the training objective and the model output. We propose a Semantic Concentration Multi-Head Self-Attention (SCMHSA) architecture, which effectively mitigates semantic dilution in transformer-based next-frame prediction. Additionally, we introduce a loss function that optimizes SCMHSA in the latent space, aligning the training objective more closely with the model output. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the original transformer-based predictors.

Existing AOT solutions are predominantly single-agent-based, which struggle in dynamic and complex scenarios due to limited information gathering and processing capabilities, often resulting in suboptimal decision-making. Alleviating these limitations necessitates the development of a multi-agent system where different agents perform distinct roles and collaborate to enhance learning and robustness in dynamic and complex environments. Although some multi-agent approaches exist for AOT, they typically rely on external auxiliary agents, which require additional devices, making them costly. In contrast, we introduce the Collaborative System for Active Object Tracking (CSAOT), a method that leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to enable multiple agents to operate on a single device, thereby improving tracking performance and reducing costs. Our approach enhances robustness against occlusions and rapid motion while optimizing camera movements to extend tracking duration. We validated the effectiveness of CSAOT on various interactive maps with dynamic and stationary obstacles.

To perform our study, we construct a series of autoregressive video models, called Toto. We treat videos as sequences of visual tokens and train transformer models to autoregressively predict future tokens. Our models are pre-trained on a diverse dataset of videos and images comprising over 1 trillion visual tokens. We explore different architectural, training, and inference design choices. We evaluate the learned visual representations on a range of downstream tasks including image recognition, video classification, object tracking, and robotics. Our results demonstrate that, despite minimal inductive biases, autoregressive pre-training leads to competitive performance across all benchmarks. Finally, we find that scaling our video models results in similar scaling curves to those seen in language models, albeit with a different rate. More details at https://brjathu.github.io/toto/

For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.

Existing Transformer-based vision-language tracking methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging the global modeling ability of self-attention. However, current approaches still face challenges in effectively exploiting the temporal information and dynamically updating reference features during tracking. Recently, the State Space Model (SSM), known as Mamba, has shown astonishing ability in efficient long-sequence modeling. Particularly, its state space evolving process demonstrates promising capabilities in memorizing multimodal temporal information with linear complexity. Witnessing its success, we propose a Mamba-based vision-language tracking model to exploit its state space evolving ability in temporal space for robust multimodal tracking, dubbed MambaVLT. In particular, our approach mainly integrates a time-evolving hybrid state space block and a selective locality enhancement block, to capture contextual information for multimodal modeling and adaptive reference feature update. Besides, we introduce a modality-selection module that dynamically adjusts the weighting between visual and language references, mitigating potential ambiguities from either reference type. Extensive experimental results show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers across diverse benchmarks.

To this end, we introduce Walker, the first self-supervised tracker that learns from videos with sparse bounding box annotations, and no tracking labels. First, we design a quasi-dense temporal object appearance graph, and propose a novel multi-positive contrastive objective to optimize random walks on the graph and learn instance similarities. Then, we introduce an algorithm to enforce mutually-exclusive connective properties across instances in the graph, optimizing the learned topology for MOT. At inference time, we propose to associate detected instances to tracklets based on the max-likelihood transition state under motion-constrained bi-directional walks. Walker is the first self-supervised tracker to achieve competitive performance on MOT17, DanceTrack, and BDD100K. Remarkably, our proposal outperforms the previous self-supervised trackers even when drastically reducing the annotation requirements by up to 400x.

Existing approaches rely on the assumption that the shape variation of the point clouds and the motion of the objects across neighboring frames are smooth, failing to cope with high temporal variation data. In this paper, we present a novel framework for 3D SOT in point clouds with high temporal variation, called HVTrack. HVTrack proposes three novel components to tackle the challenges in the high temporal variation scenario: 1) A Relative-Pose-Aware Memory module to handle temporal point cloud shape variations; 2) a Base-Expansion Feature Cross-Attention module to deal with similar object distractions in expanded search areas; 3) a Contextual Point Guided Self-Attention module for suppressing heavy background noise. We construct a dataset with high temporal variation (KITTI-HV) by setting different frame intervals for sampling in the KITTI dataset. On the KITTI-HV with 5 frame intervals, our HVTrack surpasses the state-of-the-art tracker CXTracker by 11.3%/15.7% in Success/Precision.

Traditional motion-based approaches achieve target tracking by estimating the relative movement of target between two consecutive frames. However, they usually overlook local motion information of the target and fail to exploit historical frame information effectively. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a point-level flow method with multi-frame information for 3D SOT task, called FlowTrack. Specifically, by estimating the flow for each point in the target, our method could capture the local motion details of target, thereby improving the tracking performance. At the same time, to handle scenes with sparse points, we present a learnable target feature as the bridge to efficiently integrate target information from past frames. Moreover, we design a novel Instance Flow Head to transform dense point-level flow into instance-level motion, effectively aggregating local motion information to obtain global target motion. Finally, our method achieves competitive performance with improvements of 5.9% on the KITTI dataset and 2.9% on NuScenes. The code will be made publicly available soon.

In tracking-by-detection systems, biases, false positives, and misses, which are referred to as outliers, are inevitable due to complex traffic scenarios. Recent tracking methods are based on filtering algorithms that overlook these outliers, leading to reduced tracking accuracy or even loss of the objects trajectory. To handle this challenge, we adopt a probabilistic perspective, regarding the generation of outliers as misspecification between the actual distribution of measurement data and the nominal measurement model used for filtering. We further demonstrate that, by designing a convolutional operation, we can mitigate this misspecification. Incorporating this operation into the widely used unscented Kalman filter (UKF) in commonly adopted tracking algorithms, we derive a variant of the UKF that is robust to outliers, called the convolutional UKF (ConvUKF). We show that ConvUKF maintains the Gaussian conjugate property, thus allowing for real-time tracking. We also prove that ConvUKF has a bounded tracking error in the presence of outliers, which implies robust stability. The experimental results on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets show improved accuracy compared to representative baseline algorithms for MOT tasks.

Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have been carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group behavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be seen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural environment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel dataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior recognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating all baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was subsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the original 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for baboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset, where all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This process resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior recognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a video subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated with 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark results show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\% for the YOLOv8-X detection model, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\% for the BotSort tracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\% for the X3D behavior recognition model. Using deep learning to classify wildlife behavior from drone footage facilitates non-invasive insight into the collective behavior of an entire group.

Augmented reality assembly guidance requires 6D object poses of target objects in real time. Especially in time-critical medical or industrial settings, continuous and markerless tracking of individual parts is essential to visualize instructions superimposed on or next to the target object parts. In this regard, occlusions by the user's hand or other objects and the complexity of different assembly states complicate robust and real-time markerless multi-object tracking. To address this problem, we present Graph-based Object Tracking (GBOT), a novel graph-based single-view RGB-D tracking approach. The real-time markerless multi-object tracking is initialized via 6D pose estimation and updates the graph-based assembly poses. The tracking through various assembly states is achieved by our novel multi-state assembly graph. We update the multi-state assembly graph by utilizing the relative poses of the individual assembly parts. Linking the individual objects in this graph enables more robust object tracking during the assembly process. For evaluation, we introduce a synthetic dataset of publicly available and 3D printable assembly assets as a benchmark for future work. Quantitative experiments in synthetic data and further qualitative study in real test data show that GBOT can outperform existing work towards enabling context-aware augmented reality assembly guidance.

Several algorithms have been proposed to tackle the multi-object smoothing task, where object detections can be conditioned on all the measurements in the time window. However, the best-performing methods suffer from intractable computational complexity and require approximations, performing suboptimally in complex settings. Deep learning based algorithms are a possible venue for tackling this issue but have not been applied extensively in settings where accurate multi-object models are available and measurements are low-dimensional. We propose a novel DL architecture specifically tailored for this setting that decouples the data association task from the smoothing task. We compare the performance of the proposed smoother to the state-of-the-art in different tasks of varying difficulty and provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first comparison between traditional Bayesian trackers and DL trackers in the smoothing problem setting.

Existing VidVRD methods can be broadly categorized into bottom-up and top-down paradigms, depending on their approach to classifying relations. Bottom-up methods follow a clip-based approach where they classify relations of short clip tubelet pairs and then merge them into long video relations. On the other hand, top-down methods directly classify long video tubelet pairs. While recent video-based methods utilizing video tubelets have shown promising results, we argue that the effective modeling of spatial and temporal context plays a more significant role than the choice between clip tubelets and video tubelets. This motivates us to revisit the clip-based paradigm and explore the key success factors in VidVRD. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Context Model (HCM) that enriches the object-based spatial context and relation-based temporal context based on clips. We demonstrate that using clip tubelets can achieve superior performance compared to most video-based methods. Additionally, using clip tubelets offers more flexibility in model designs and helps alleviate the limitations associated with video tubelets, such as the challenging long-term object tracking problem and the loss of temporal information in long-term tubelet feature compression. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging VidVRD benchmarks validate that our HCM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating advanced spatial and temporal context modeling within the clip-based paradigm.

Previous methods usually input the last two frames and use the predicted box to get the template point cloud in previous frame and the search area point cloud in the current frame respectively, then use similarity-based or motion-based methods to predict the current box. Although these methods achieved good tracking performance, they ignore the historical information of the target, which is important for tracking. In this paper, compared to inputting two frames of point clouds, we input multi-frame of point clouds to encode the spatio-temporal information of the target and learn the motion information of the target implicitly, which could build the correlations among different frames to track the target in the current frame efficiently. Meanwhile, rather than directly using the point feature for feature fusion, we first crop the point cloud features into many patches and then use sparse attention mechanism to encode the patch-level similarity and finally fuse the multi-frame features. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive results on challenging large-scale benchmarks (62.6% in KITTI and 49.66% in NuScenes).

This challenge arises from two main factors: the insufficient discriminability of ReID features and the predominant utilization of linear motion models in MOT. In this context, we introduce a novel motion-based tracker, MotionTrack, centered around a learnable motion predictor that relies solely on object trajectory information. This predictor comprehensively integrates two levels of granularity in motion features to enhance the modeling of temporal dynamics and facilitate precise future motion prediction for individual objects. Specifically, the proposed approach adopts a self-attention mechanism to capture token-level information and a Dynamic MLP layer to model channel-level features. MotionTrack is a simple, online tracking approach. Our experimental results demonstrate that MotionTrack yields state-of-the-art performance on datasets such as Dancetrack and SportsMOT, characterized by highly complex object motion.

Mainstream methods mainly rely on point clouds to achieve geometry matching between target template and search area. However, textureless and incomplete point clouds make it difficult for single-modal trackers to distinguish objects with similar structures. To overcome the limitations of geometry matching, we propose a Multi-modal Multi-level Fusion Tracker (MMF-Track), which exploits the image texture and geometry characteristic of point clouds to track 3D target. Specifically, we first propose a Space Alignment Module (SAM) to align RGB images with point clouds in 3D space, which is the prerequisite for constructing inter-modal associations. Then, in feature interaction level, we design a Feature Interaction Module (FIM) based on dual-stream structure, which enhances intra-modal features in parallel and constructs inter-modal semantic associations. Meanwhile, in order to refine each modal feature, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine Interaction Module (CFIM) to realize the hierarchical feature interaction at different scales. Finally, in similarity fusion level, we propose a Similarity Fusion Module (SFM) to aggregate geometry and texture clues from the target. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI (39% Success and 42% Precision gains against previous multi-modal method) and is also competitive on NuScenes.

Being able to identify and track all the pedestrians in the dense crowd scene with computer vision approaches is a typical challenge in this field, also known as the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) challenge. Modern trackers are required to operate on more and more complicated scenes. According to the MOT20 challenge result, the pedestrian is 4 times denser than the MOT17 challenge. Hence, improving the ability to detect and track in extremely crowded scenes is the aim of this work. In light of the occlusion issue with the human body, the heads are usually easier to identify. In this work, we have designed a joint head and body detector in an anchor-free style to boost the detection recall and precision performance of pedestrians in both small and medium sizes. Innovatively, our model does not require information on the statistical head-body ratio for common pedestrians detection for training. Instead, the proposed model learns the ratio dynamically. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we evaluate the model with extensive experiments on different datasets, including MOT20, Crowdhuman, and HT21 datasets. As a result, our proposed method significantly improves both the recall and precision rate on small & medium sized pedestrians and achieves state-of-the-art results in these challenging datasets.

However, the full spectrum of challenges of egocentric tracking faced by an embodied AI is underrepresented in many existing datasets; these tend to focus on relatively short, third-person videos. Egocentric video has several distinguishing characteristics from those commonly found in past datasets: frequent large camera motions and hand interactions with objects commonly lead to occlusions or objects exiting the frame, and object appearance can change rapidly due to widely different points of view, scale, or object states. Embodied tracking is also naturally long-term, and being able to consistently (re-)associate objects to their appearances and disappearances over as long as a lifetime is critical. Previous datasets under-emphasize this re-detection problem, and their "framed" nature has led to adoption of various spatiotemporal priors that we find do not necessarily generalize to egocentric video. We thus introduce EgoTracks, a new dataset for long-term egocentric visual object tracking. Sourced from the Ego4D dataset, this new dataset presents a significant challenge to recent state-of-the-art single-object tracking models, which we find score poorly on traditional tracking metrics for our new dataset, compared to popular benchmarks. We further show improvements that can be made to a STARK tracker to significantly increase its performance on egocentric data, resulting in a baseline model we call EgoSTARK. We publicly release our annotations and benchmark, hoping our dataset leads to further advancements in tracking.

Estimating a sound's time delay requires finding correspondences between the signals recorded by each microphone.

We adapt the contrastive random walk of Jabri et al. to learn a cycle-consistent representation from unlabeled stereo sounds, resulting in a model that performs on par with supervised methods on "in the wild" internet recordings. We also propose a multimodal contrastive learning model that solves a visually-guided localization task: estimating the time delay for a particular person in a multi-speaker mixture, given a visual representation of their face.

While recent progress in implicit function has shown encouraging results on high-quality 3D shape reconstruction, it is still very challenging to generalize to cluttered and partially observable LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose to leverage the continuity in video data. We introduce a novel and unified framework which utilizes a neural implicit function to simultaneously track and reconstruct 3D objects in the wild. Our approach adapts the DeepSDF model (i.e., an instantiation of the implicit function) in the video online, iteratively improving the shape reconstruction while in return improving the tracking, and vice versa. We experiment with both Waymo and KITTI datasets and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for both tracking and shape reconstruction tasks.

A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets, respectively.

However, vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive.

In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

Single-agent tracking offers resilience to adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.

In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba, leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First, we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV tracking.

Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles. By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset, where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks, including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various testing sequences.

We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

Predicting player positions in such scenarios is particularly difficult due to the observed highly non-linear motion patterns. Current methods are heavily reliant on object detection and appearance-based tracking, which struggle to perform in complex team sports scenarios, where appearance cues are ambiguous and motion patterns do not necessarily follow a linear pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce SportMamba, an adaptive hybrid MOT technique specifically designed for tracking in dynamic team sports. The technical contribution of SportMamba is twofold. First, we introduce a mamba-attention mechanism that models non-linear motion by implicitly focusing on relevant embedding dependencies. Second, we propose a height-adaptive spatial association metric to reduce ID switches caused by partial occlusions by accounting for scale variations due to depth changes. Additionally, we extend the detection search space with adaptive buffers to improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. Our proposed technique, SportMamba, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the SportsMOT dataset, which is characterized by complex motion and severe occlusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to VIP-HTD, an ice hockey dataset.

While deep learning-based solutions have demonstrated impressive 3D MOT performance, model-based approaches remain appealing for their simplicity, interpretability, and data efficiency. Conventional model-based trackers typically rely on random vector-based Bayesian filters within the tracking-by-detection (TBD) framework but face limitations due to heuristic data association and track management schemes. In contrast, random finite set (RFS)-based Bayesian filtering handles object birth, survival, and death in a theoretically sound manner, facilitating interpretability and parameter tuning. In this paper, we present OptiPMB, a novel RFS-based 3D MOT method that employs an optimized Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter while incorporating several key innovative designs within the TBD framework. Specifically, we propose a measurement-driven hybrid adaptive birth model for improved track initialization, employ adaptive detection probability parameters to effectively maintain tracks for occluded objects, and optimize density pruning and track extraction modules to further enhance overall tracking performance. Extensive evaluations on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show that OptiPMB achieves superior tracking accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, thereby establishing a new benchmark for model-based 3D MOT and offering valuable insights for future research on RFS-based trackers in autonomous driving.

Neuromorphic Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) or event cameras, inspired by biological vision, offer a promising alternative to conventional frame-based cameras. These cameras can detect changes in intensity asynchronously, even in challenging lighting conditions, with a high dynamic range and resistance to motion blur. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are increasingly used to process these event-based signals efficiently and asynchronously. Meanwhile, physics-based artificial intelligence (AI) provides a means to incorporate system-level knowledge into neural networks via physical modeling. This enhances robustness, energy efficiency, and provides symbolic explainability. In this work, we present a neuromorphic navigation framework for autonomous drone navigation. The focus is on detecting and navigating through moving gates while avoiding collisions. We use event cameras for detecting moving objects through a shallow SNN architecture in an unsupervised manner. This is combined with a lightweight energy-aware physics-guided neural network (PgNN) trained with depth inputs to predict optimal flight times, generating near-minimum energy paths. The system is implemented in the Gazebo simulator and integrates a sensor-fused vision-to-planning neuro-symbolic framework built with the Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware. This work highlights the future potential of integrating event-based vision with physics-guided planning for energy-efficient autonomous navigation, particularly for low-latency decision-making.

Current methodologies that process video frames sequentially struggle to maintain coherent tracking of objects, especially when these objects temporarily vanish and later reappear in the footage. A critical limitation of these approaches is their inability to effectively identify crucial moments in the video, largely due to their limited grasp of temporal relationships. To overcome these obstacles, we present GraphVideoAgent, a cutting-edge system that leverages the power of graph-based object tracking in conjunction with large language model capabilities. At its core, our framework employs a dynamic graph structure that maps and monitors the evolving relationships between visual entities throughout the video sequence. This innovative approach enables more nuanced understanding of how objects interact and transform over time, facilitating improved frame selection through comprehensive contextual awareness. Our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness when tested against industry benchmarks. In evaluations on the EgoSchema dataset, GraphVideoAgent achieved a 2.2 improvement over existing methods while requiring analysis of only 8.2 frames on average. Similarly, testing on the NExT-QA benchmark yielded a 2.0 performance increase with an average frame requirement of 8.1. These results underscore the efficiency of our graph-guided methodology in enhancing both accuracy and computational performance in long-form video understanding tasks.

In this preliminary work, we focus on single object tracking. We first developed a fast heuristic object detector that utilizes prior information about the environment and target. The resulting target points are subsequently fed into an extended object tracking framework, where the target shape is parameterized using a star-convex hypersurface model. Experimental results show that our object tracking method using a stereo camera achieves performance similar to that of a LiDAR sensor, with a cost difference of more than tenfold.

This issue amalgamates the complexities of open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) and multi-object tracking (MOT). Existing approaches to OVMOT often merge OVD and MOT methodologies as separate modules, predominantly focusing on the problem through an image-centric lens. In this paper, we propose VOVTrack, a novel method that integrates object states relevant to MOT and video-centric training to address this challenge from a video object tracking standpoint. First, we consider the tracking-related state of the objects during tracking and propose a new prompt-guided attention mechanism for more accurate localization and classification (detection) of the time-varying objects. Subsequently, we leverage raw video data without annotations for training by formulating a self-supervised object similarity learning technique to facilitate temporal object association (tracking). Experimental results underscore that VOVTrack outperforms existing methods, establishing itself as a state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary tracking task.

Like single-camera multiple-object tracking, it is commonly formulated as a graph problem of tracking-by-detection. Within this framework, existing online methods usually consist of two-stage procedures that cluster temporally first, then spatially, or vice versa. This is computationally expensive and prone to error accumulation. We introduce a graph representation that allows spatial-temporal clustering in a single, combined step: New detections are spatially and temporally connected with existing clusters. By keeping sparse appearance and positional cues of all detections in a cluster, our method can compare clusters based on the strongest available evidence. The final tracks are obtained online using a simple multicut assignment procedure. Our method does not require any training on the target scene, pre-extraction of single-camera tracks, or additional annotations. Notably, we outperform the online state-of-the-art on the CityFlow dataset in terms of IDF1 by more than 14%, and on the Synthehicle dataset by more than 25%, respectively. The code is publicly available.

Changes in illumination (shadows), object pose, or the movement of non-rigid objects can drastically alter available image features. How do biological visual systems track objects as they change? One plausible mechanism involves attentional mechanisms for reasoning about the locations of objects independently of their appearances -- a capability that prominent neuroscience theories have associated with computing through neural synchrony. Here, we describe a novel deep learning circuit that can learn to precisely control attention to features separately from their location in the world through neural synchrony: the complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN). Next, we compare object tracking in humans, the CV-RNN, and other deep neural networks (DNNs), using FeatureTracker: a large-scale challenge that asks observers to track objects as their locations and appearances change in precisely controlled ways. While humans effortlessly solved FeatureTracker, state-of-the-art DNNs did not. In contrast, our CV-RNN behaved similarly to humans on the challenge, providing a computational proof-of-concept for the role of phase synchronization as a neural substrate for tracking appearance-morphing objects as they move about.

In these settings, objects frequently move in coordinated patterns, occlude each other, and exhibit long-term dependencies in their trajectories. However, it remains a key open research question on how to model long-range dependencies within tracklets, interdependencies among tracklets, and the associated temporal occlusions. To this end, we introduce Samba, a novel linear-time set-of-sequences model designed to jointly process multiple tracklets by synchronizing the multiple selective state-spaces used to model each tracklet. Samba autoregressively predicts the future track query for each sequence while maintaining synchronized long-term memory representations across tracklets. By integrating Samba into a tracking-by-propagation framework, we propose SambaMOTR, the first tracker effectively addressing the aforementioned issues, including long-range dependencies, tracklet interdependencies, and temporal occlusions. Additionally, we introduce an effective technique for dealing with uncertain observations (MaskObs) and an efficient training recipe to scale SambaMOTR to longer sequences. By modeling long-range dependencies and interactions among tracked objects, SambaMOTR implicitly learns to track objects accurately through occlusions without any hand-crafted heuristics. Our approach significantly surpasses prior state-of-the-art on the DanceTrack, BFT, and SportsMOT datasets.

In this work, we build OCTrackB, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark, to provide a standard evaluation platform for the OCMOT problem. Compared to previous datasets, OCTrackB has more abundant and balanced base/novel classes and the corresponding samples for evaluation with less bias. We also propose a new multi-granularity recognition metric to better evaluate the generative object recognition in OCMOT.

However, building a surrogate model with high accuracy and fast inference speed can be challenging for soft robotics due to the nonlinearity from complex geometry, large deformation, material nonlinearity etc. The reality gap from surrogate models also prevents their further deployment in the soft robotics domain. In this study, we proposed a physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) named PINN-Ray to model complex deformation for a Fin Ray soft robotic gripper, which embeds the minimum potential energy principle from elastic mechanics and additional high-fidelity experimental data into the loss function of neural network for training. This method is significant in terms of its generalisation to complex geometry and robust to data scarcity as compared to other data-driven neural networks. Furthermore, it has been extensively evaluated to model the deformation of the Fin Ray finger under external actuation. PINN-Ray demonstrates improved accuracy as compared with Finite element modelling (FEM) after applying the data assimilation scheme to treat the sim-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduced our automated framework to design, fabricate soft robotic fingers, and characterise their deformation by visual tracking, which provides a guideline for the fast prototype of soft robotics.

To address these challenges, incorporating the advantages of multiple visual modalities is a promising solution for achieving reliable object tracking. However, the existing approaches usually integrate multimodal inputs through adaptive local feature interactions, which cannot leverage the full potential of visual cues, thus resulting in insufficient feature modeling. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal hybrid tracker (MMHT) that utilizes frame-event-based data for reliable single object tracking. The MMHT model employs a hybrid backbone consisting of an artificial neural network (ANN) and a spiking neural network (SNN) to extract dominant features from different visual modalities and then uses a unified encoder to align the features across different domains. Moreover, we propose an enhanced transformer-based module to fuse multimodal features using attention mechanisms. With these methods, the MMHT model can effectively construct a multiscale and multidimensional visual feature space and achieve discriminative feature modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MMHT model exhibits competitive performance in comparison with that of other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of the MMHT model in terms of addressing the challenges faced in visual object tracking tasks.

Managing non-cooperative traffic presents the most important challenge in this problem. The most efficient strategy for handling non-cooperative traffic is based on monocular video processing through deep learning models. This study contributes to the vision-based deep learning aircraft detection and tracking literature by investigating the impact of data corruption arising from environmental and hardware conditions on the effectiveness of these methods. More specifically, we designed $7$ types of common corruptions for camera inputs taking into account real-world flight conditions. By applying these corruptions to the Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) dataset we constructed the first robustness benchmark dataset named AOT-C for air-to-air aerial object detection. The corruptions included in this dataset cover a wide range of challenging conditions such as adverse weather and sensor noise. The second main contribution of this letter is to present an extensive experimental evaluation involving $8$ diverse object detectors to explore the degradation in the performance under escalating levels of corruptions (domain shifts). Based on the evaluation results, the key observations that emerge are the following: 1) One-stage detectors of the YOLO family demonstrate better robustness, 2) Transformer-based and multi-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN are extremely vulnerable to corruptions, 3) Robustness against corruptions is related to the generalization ability of models. The third main contribution is to present that finetuning on our augmented synthetic data results in improvements in the generalisation ability of the object detector in real-world flight experiments.

Detecting non-cooperative aerial vehicles with efficiency and estimating collisions accurately are pivotal for achieving fully autonomous aircraft and facilitating Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). This paper presents a deep-learning framework that utilizes optical sensors for the detection, tracking, and distance estimation of non-cooperative aerial vehicles. In implementing this comprehensive sensing framework, the availability of depth information is essential for enabling autonomous aerial vehicles to perceive and navigate around obstacles. In this work, we propose a method for estimating the distance information of a detected aerial object in real time using only the input of a monocular camera. In order to train our deep learning components for the object detection, tracking and depth estimation tasks we utilize the Amazon Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) Dataset. In contrast to previous approaches that integrate the depth estimation module into the object detector, our method formulates the problem as image-to-image translation. We employ a separate lightweight encoder-decoder network for efficient and robust depth estimation. In a nutshell, the object detection module identifies and localizes obstacles, conveying this information to both the tracking module for monitoring obstacle movement and the depth estimation module for calculating distances. Our approach is evaluated on the Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) dataset which is the largest (to the best of our knowledge) air-to-air airborne object dataset.

To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel representation, extended bounding field-of-view (eBFoV), for target localization and use it as the foundation of a general 360 tracking framework which is applicable for both omnidirectional visual object tracking and segmentation tasks. Building upon our previous work on omnidirectional visual object tracking (360VOT), we propose a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that incorporates a new component called omnidirectional video object segmentation (360VOS). The 360VOS dataset includes 290 sequences accompanied by dense pixel-wise masks and covers a broader range of target categories. To support both the development and evaluation of algorithms in this domain, we divide the dataset into a training subset with 170 sequences and a testing subset with 120 sequences. Furthermore, we tailor evaluation metrics for both omnidirectional tracking and segmentation to ensure rigorous assessment. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 360 tracking framework and training dataset.

However, most top-performing tracking algorithms rely on many hand-crafted components for spatio-temporal information aggregation. Consequently, the spatio-temporal information is far away from being fully explored. To alleviate this issue, we propose an adaptive tracker with spatio-temporal transformers (named AQATrack), which adopts simple autoregressive queries to effectively learn spatio-temporal information without many hand-designed components. Firstly, we introduce a set of learnable and autoregressive queries to capture the instantaneous target appearance changes in a sliding window fashion. Then, we design a novel attention mechanism for the interaction of existing queries to generate a new query in current frame. Finally, based on the initial target template and learnt autoregressive queries, a spatio-temporal information fusion module (STM) is designed for spatiotemporal formation aggregation to locate a target object. Benefiting from the STM, we can effectively combine the static appearance and instantaneous changes to guide robust tracking. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the tracker's performance on six popular tracking benchmarks: LaSOT, LaSOText, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2K, and UAV123.

But, it is a challenging task due to the non-linear motion of players, the similarity in appearance of players from the same team, and frequent occlusions. Therefore, the ability to extract meaningful embeddings to represent players is crucial in developing an effective tracking and re-identification system. In this paper, a multi-purpose part-based person representation method, called PRTreID, is proposed that performs three tasks of role classification, team affiliation, and re-identification, simultaneously. In contrast to available literature, a single network is trained with multi-task supervision to solve all three tasks, jointly. The proposed joint method is computationally efficient due to the shared backbone. Also, the multi-task learning leads to richer and more discriminative representations, as demonstrated by both quantitative and qualitative results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PRTreID, it is integrated with a state-of-the-art tracking method, using a part-based post-processing module to handle long-term tracking. The proposed tracking method outperforms all existing tracking methods on the challenging SoccerNet tracking dataset.

Tracking-by-detection has long been a dominant paradigm for object tracking of specific object categories. Recently, large-scale pre-trained models have shown promising advances in detecting and segmenting objects and parts in 2D static images in the wild. This begs the question: can we re-purpose these large-scale pre-trained static image models for open-vocabulary video tracking? In this paper, we re-purpose an open-vocabulary detector, segmenter, and dense optical flow estimator, into a model that tracks and segments objects of any category in 2D videos. Our method predicts object and part tracks with associated language descriptions in monocular videos, rebuilding the pipeline of Tractor with modern large pre-trained models for static image detection and segmentation: we detect open-vocabulary object instances and propagate their boxes from frame to frame using a flow-based motion model, refine the propagated boxes with the box regression module of the visual detector, and prompt an open-world segmenter with the refined box to segment the objects. We decide the termination of an object track based on the objectness score of the propagated boxes, as well as forward-backward optical flow consistency. We re-identify objects across occlusions using deep feature matching. We show that our model achieves strong performance on multiple established video object segmentation and tracking benchmarks, and can produce reasonable tracks in manipulation data. In particular, our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art in UVO and BURST, benchmarks for open-world object tracking and segmentation, despite never being explicitly trained for tracking. We hope that our approach can serve as a simple and extensible framework for future research.

Biologically inspired neuromorphic event cameras are emerging as a powerful alternative to frame-based cameras, due to their ability to asynchronously detect varying intensities (even in poor lighting conditions), high dynamic range, and robustness to motion blur. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained traction for processing events asynchronously in an energy-efficient manner. On the other hand, physics-based artificial intelligence (AI) has gained prominence recently, as they enable embedding system knowledge via physical modeling inside traditional analog neural networks (ANNs). In this letter, we present an event-based physics-guided neuromorphic planner (EV-Planner) to perform obstacle avoidance using neuromorphic event cameras and physics-based AI. We consider the task of autonomous drone navigation where the mission is to detect moving gates and fly through them while avoiding a collision. We use event cameras to perform object detection using a shallow spiking neural network in an unsupervised fashion. Utilizing the physical equations of the brushless DC motors present in the drone rotors, we train a lightweight energy-aware physics-guided neural network (PgNN) with depth inputs. This predicts the optimal flight time responsible for generating near-minimum energy paths. We spawn the drone in the Gazebo simulator and implement a sensor-fused vision-to-planning neuro-symbolic framework using Robot Operating System (ROS). Simulation results for safe collision-free flight trajectories are presented with performance analysis, ablation study and potential future research directions

However, inefficient data utilization and limited evaluation methods more seriously hinder SOT research. The former causes existing datasets can not be exploited comprehensively, while the latter neglects challenging factors in the evaluation process. In this article, we systematize the representative benchmarks and form a Single Object Tracking metaverse (SOTVerse) -- a user-defined SOT task space to break through the bottleneck. We first propose a 3E Paradigm to describe tasks by three components (i.e., environment, evaluation, and executor). Then, we summarize task characteristics, clarify the organization standards, and construct SOTVerse with 12.56 million frames. Specifically, SOTVerse automatically labels challenging factors per frame, allowing users to generate user-defined spaces efficiently via construction rules. Besides, SOTVerse provides two mechanisms with new indicators and successfully evaluates trackers under various subtasks. Consequently, SOTVerse first provides a strategy to improve resource utilization in the computer vision area, making research more standardized and scientific.

To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance, thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves superior accuracy, stability and generalization across varying safe distances, trajectories, and target velocities. Furthermore, a real-world experiment on a quadrotor with an onboard computer validated practicality of the proposed approach.

Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.

In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking in complex scenarios.

Through controlled Online Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements (AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

Over the past two decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers, discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks, highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

Existing literature commonly relies on constant motion models for estimating the states of objects, neglecting the complex motion dynamics unique to each object. Consequently, trajectory division and imprecise object localization arise, especially under occlusion conditions. The core of these challenges lies in the limitations of the current Kalman filter formulation, which fails to account for the variability of motion dynamics as objects navigate their environments. This work introduces a novel formulation of the Kalman filter that incorporates motion dynamics, allowing the motion model to adaptively adjust according to changes in the object's movement. The proposed Kalman filter substantially improves state estimation, localization, and trajectory prediction compared to the traditional Kalman filter. This is reflected in tracking performance that surpasses recent benchmarks on the KITTI and Waymo Open Datasets, with margins of 0.56\% and 0.81\% in higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) and multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed Kalman filter consistently outperforms the baseline across various detectors. Additionally, it shows an enhanced capability in managing long occlusions compared to the baseline Kalman filter, achieving margins of 1.22\% in higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) and 1.55\% in multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) on the KITTI dataset. The formulation's efficiency is evident, with an additional processing time of only approximately 0.078 ms per frame, ensuring its applicability in real-time applications.

To address these issues, this paper pro-poses a novel Siamese Motion Mamba Tracker (SMMT), which integrates a bidirectional state-space model and a self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce the Motion Mamba module into the Siamese architecture to ex-tract motion features and recover overlooked edge details using bidirectional modeling and self-attention. We propose a Siamese parameter-sharing strate-gy that allows certain convolutional layers to share weights. This approach reduces computational redundancy while preserving strong feature represen-tation. In addition, we design a motion edge-aware regression loss to improve tracking accuracy, especially for motion-blurred targets. Extensive experi-ments are conducted on four TIR tracking benchmarks, including LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR 2017. The results show that SMMT achieves superior performance in TIR target tracking.

However, as a foundational model on interactive segmentation, SAM2 performs segmentation directly based on mask memory from the past six frames, leading to two significant challenges. Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may disappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object motion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities. Secondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it susceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion, due to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these problems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate object motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory. Firstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object motion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a set of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards the direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we devise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically identifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and frame-level. By eliminating potentially inaccurate mask predictions from memory, we can leverage more reliable memory features to exploit similar regions for improving segmentation results. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks of video object segmentation and video instance segmentation demonstrate that our MoSAM achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other competitors.

Consequently, studying vision-based underwater robot navigation and control has recently gained increasing attention to counter the numerous challenges faced in underwater conditions, such as lighting variability, turbidity, camera image distortions (due to bubbles), and ROV positional disturbances (due to underwater currents). In this paper, we propose (to the best of our knowledge) a first rigorous unified benchmarking of more than seven Machine Learning (ML)-based one-shot object tracking algorithms for vision-based position locking of ROV platforms. We propose a position-locking system that processes images of an object of interest in front of which the ROV must be kept stable. Then, our proposed system uses the output result of different object tracking algorithms to automatically correct the position of the ROV against external disturbances. We conducted numerous real-world experiments using a BlueROV2 platform within an indoor pool and provided clear demonstrations of the strengths and weaknesses of each tracking approach. Finally, to help alleviate the scarcity of underwater ROV data, we release our acquired data base as open-source with the hope of benefiting future research.

In this work, we introduce VideoMindPalace, a new framework inspired by the "Mind Palace", which organizes critical video moments into a topologically structured semantic graph. VideoMindPalace organizes key information through (i) hand-object tracking and interaction, (ii) clustered activity zones representing specific areas of recurring activities, and (iii) environment layout mapping, allowing natural language parsing by LLMs to provide grounded insights on spatio-temporal and 3D context. In addition, we propose the Video MindPalace Benchmark (VMB), to assess human-like reasoning, including spatial localization, temporal reasoning, and layout-aware sequential understanding. Evaluated on VMB and established video QA datasets, including EgoSchema, NExT-QA, IntentQA, and the Active Memories Benchmark, VideoMindPalace demonstrates notable gains in spatio-temporal coherence and human-aligned reasoning, advancing long-form video analysis capabilities in VLMs.

Among tactile-dependent skills, tactile-based object tracking serves as the cornerstone for many tasks, including manipulation, in-hand manipulation, and 3D reconstruction. In this work, we introduce NormalFlow, a fast, robust, and real-time tactile-based 6DoF tracking algorithm. Leveraging the precise surface normal estimation of vision-based tactile sensors, NormalFlow determines object movements by minimizing discrepancies between the tactile-derived surface normals. Our results show that NormalFlow consistently outperforms competitive baselines and can track low-texture objects like table surfaces. For long-horizon tracking, we demonstrate when rolling the sensor around a bead for 360 degrees, NormalFlow maintains a rotational tracking error of 2.5 degrees. Additionally, we present state-of-the-art tactile-based 3D reconstruction results, showcasing the high accuracy of NormalFlow. We believe NormalFlow unlocks new possibilities for high-precision perception and manipulation tasks that involve interacting with objects using hands.

The design of a Switched Visual Tracker (SVT) is presented which aims to meet the competing requirements of maintaining both proximity and visibility. SVT alternates between a visual tracking mode for following the target, and a recovery mode for regaining visual contact when the target falls out of sight. We establish the stability of SVT by extending the average dwell time theorem from switched systems theory, which may be of independent interest. Our implementation of SVT on an Agilicious drone [1] illustrates its effectiveness on tracking various target trajectories: it reduces the average tracking error by up to 45% and significantly improves visibility duration compared to a baseline algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles intermittent vision loss, offering enhanced robustness and adaptability for real-world autonomous missions. Additionally, we demonstrate how the stability analysis provides valuable guidance for selecting parameters, such as tracking speed and recovery distance, to optimize the SVT's performance.

Initial approaches to MOT attacks primarily aimed to degrade the detection quality of the frames under attack, thereby reducing accuracy only in those specific frames, highlighting a lack of \textit{efficiency}. To improve efficiency, recent advancements manipulate object positions to cause persistent identity (ID) switches during the association phase, even after the attack ends within a few frames. However, these position-manipulating attacks have inherent limitations, as they can be easily counteracted by adjusting distance-related parameters in the association phase, revealing a lack of \textit{robustness}. In this paper, we present \textsf{BankTweak}, a novel adversarial attack designed for MOT trackers, which features efficiency and robustness. \textsf{BankTweak} focuses on the feature extractor in the association phase and reveals vulnerability in the Hungarian matching method used by feature-based MOT systems. Exploiting the vulnerability, \textsf{BankTweak} induces persistent ID switches (addressing \textit{efficiency}) even after the attack ends by strategically injecting altered features into the feature banks without modifying object positions (addressing \textit{robustness}). To demonstrate the applicability, we apply \textsf{BankTweak} to three multi-object trackers (DeepSORT, StrongSORT, and MOTDT) with one-stage, two-stage, anchor-free, and transformer detectors. Extensive experiments on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets show that our method substantially surpasses existing attacks, exposing the vulnerability of the tracking-by-detection framework to \textsf{BankTweak}.

Existing methods often use threshold-based filtering for detection scores, which can fail for distant and occluded objects, leading to false positives. To tackle this, we propose a novel track validity mechanism and multi-stage observational gating process, significantly reducing ghost tracks and enhancing tracking performance. Our method achieves a $29.47\%$ improvement in Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) on the KITTI validation dataset with the Second detector. Additionally, a refined Kalman filter term reduces localization noise, improving higher-order tracking accuracy (HOTA) by $4.8\%$. The online framework, RobMOT, outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple detectors, with HOTA improvements of up to $3.92\%$ on the KITTI testing dataset and $8.7\%$ on the validation dataset, while achieving low identity switch scores. RobMOT excels in challenging scenarios, tracking distant objects and prolonged occlusions, with a $1.77\%$ MOTA improvement on the Waymo Open dataset, and operates at a remarkable 3221 FPS on a single CPU, proving its efficiency for real-time multi-object tracking.

However, these bounding boxes are expensive and time-consuming to annotate, in particular for large scale datasets. In this paper, we propose to learn tracking representations from single point annotations (i.e., 4.5x faster to annotate than the traditional bounding box) in a weakly supervised manner. Specifically, we propose a soft contrastive learning (SoCL) framework that incorporates target objectness prior into end-to-end contrastive learning. Our SoCL consists of adaptive positive and negative sample generation, which is memory-efficient and effective for learning tracking representations. We apply the learned representation of SoCL to visual tracking and show that our method can 1) achieve better performance than the fully supervised baseline trained with box annotations under the same annotation time cost; 2) achieve comparable performance of the fully supervised baseline by using the same number of training frames and meanwhile reducing annotation time cost by 78% and total fees by 85%; 3) be robust to annotation noise.

The robustness of SOT faces two main challenges: tiny target and fast motion. These challenges are especially manifested in videos captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), where the target is usually far away from the camera and often with significant motion relative to the camera. To evaluate the robustness of SOT methods, we propose BioDrone -- the first bionic drone-based visual benchmark for SOT. Unlike existing UAV datasets, BioDrone features videos captured from a flapping-wing UAV system with a major camera shake due to its aerodynamics. BioDrone hence highlights the tracking of tiny targets with drastic changes between consecutive frames, providing a new robust vision benchmark for SOT. To date, BioDrone offers the largest UAV-based SOT benchmark with high-quality fine-grained manual annotations and automatically generates frame-level labels, designed for robust vision analyses. Leveraging our proposed BioDrone, we conduct a systematic evaluation of existing SOT methods, comparing the performance of 20 representative models and studying novel means of optimizing a SOTA method (KeepTrack KeepTrack) for robust SOT. Our evaluation leads to new baselines and insights for robust SOT. Moving forward, we hope that BioDrone will not only serve as a high-quality benchmark for robust SOT, but also invite future research into robust computer vision.

To build spatial AI systems that can quickly be taught about new objects, we need to effectively solve the problem of single-shot object detection, instance segmentation and re-identification. So far there is neither a method fulfilling all of these requirements in unison nor a benchmark that could be used to test such a method. Addressing this, we propose ISAR, a benchmark and baseline method for single- and few-shot object Instance Segmentation And Re-identification, in an effort to accelerate the development of algorithms that can robustly detect, segment, and re-identify objects from a single or a few sparse training examples. We provide a semi-synthetic dataset of video sequences with ground-truth semantic annotations, a standardized evaluation pipeline, and a baseline method.

Automotive radar (77 to 81 GHz), which offers weather-resilient sensing, provides a complementary capability to the vision- or LiDAR-based autonomous driving systems. Raw radio-frequency (RF) radar tensors contain rich spatiotemporal semantics besides 3D location information. The majority of previous methods take in 3D (Doppler-range-azimuth) RF radar tensors, allowing prediction of an object's location, heading angle, and size in bird's-eye-view (BEV). However, they lack the ability to at the same time infer objects' size, orientation, and identity in the 3D space. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient joint architecture called CenterRadarNet, designed to facilitate high-resolution representation learning from 4D (Doppler-range-azimuth-elevation) radar data for 3D object detection and re-identification (re-ID) tasks. As a single-stage 3D object detector, CenterRadarNet directly infers the BEV object distribution confidence maps, corresponding 3D bounding box attributes, and appearance embedding for each pixel. Moreover, we build an online tracker utilizing the learned appearance embedding for re-ID. CenterRadarNet achieves the state-of-the-art result on the K-Radar 3D object detection benchmark. In addition, we present the first 3D object-tracking result using radar on the K-Radar dataset V2. In diverse driving scenarios, CenterRadarNet shows consistent, robust performance, emphasizing its wide applicability.

The labeling cost and the huge computational complexity hinder their applications on edge devices. Unsupervised learning methods have also been investigated to reduce the labeling cost but their complexity remains high. Aiming at lightweight high-performance tracking, feasibility without offline pre-training, and algorithmic transparency, we propose a new single object tracking method, called the green object tracker (GOT), in this work. GOT conducts an ensemble of three prediction branches for robust box tracking: 1) a global object-based correlator to predict the object location roughly, 2) a local patch-based correlator to build temporal correlations of small spatial units, and 3) a superpixel-based segmentator to exploit the spatial information of the target frame. GOT offers competitive tracking accuracy with state-of-the-art unsupervised trackers, which demand heavy offline pre-training, at a lower computation cost. GOT has a tiny model size (<3k parameters) and low inference complexity (around 58M FLOPs per frame). Since its inference complexity is between 0.1%-10% of DL trackers, it can be easily deployed on mobile and edge devices.

However, tracking, as a fundamental vision problem, surprisingly enjoys less bonus from recent flourishing VL learning. We argue that the reasons are two-fold: the lack of large-scale vision-language annotated videos and ineffective vision-language interaction learning of current works. These nuisances motivate us to design more effective vision-language representation for tracking, meanwhile constructing a large database with language annotation for model learning. Particularly, in this paper, we first propose a general attribute annotation strategy to decorate videos in six popular tracking benchmarks, which contributes a large-scale vision-language tracking database with more than 23,000 videos. We then introduce a novel framework to improve tracking by learning a unified-adaptive VL representation, where the cores are the proposed asymmetric architecture search and modality mixer (ModaMixer). To further improve VL representation, we introduce a contrastive loss to align different modalities. To thoroughly evidence the effectiveness of our method, we integrate the proposed framework on three tracking methods with different designs, i.e., the CNN-based SiamCAR, the Transformer-based OSTrack, and the hybrid structure TransT. The experiments demonstrate that our framework can significantly improve all baselines on six benchmarks. Besides empirical results, we theoretically analyze our approach to show its rationality. By revealing the potential of VL representation, we expect the community to divert more attention to VL tracking and hope to open more possibilities for future tracking with diversified multimodal messages.

Three dimensional DCT (3D DCT) approximations are formalized in terms of high-order tensor theory. The formulation is extended to higher dimensions with arbitrary lengths. Several multiplierless $8\times 8\times 8$ approximate methods are proposed and the computational complexity is discussed for the general multidimensional case. The proposed methods complexity cost was assessed, presenting considerably lower arithmetic operations when compared with the exact 3D DCT. The proposed approximations were embedded into 3D DCT-based video coding scheme and a modified quantization step was introduced. The simulation results showed that the approximate 3D DCT coding methods offer almost identical output visual quality when compared with exact 3D DCT scheme. The proposed 3D approximations were also employed as a tool for visual tracking. The approximate 3D DCT-based proposed system performs similarly to the original exact 3D DCT-based method. In general, the suggested methods showed competitive performance at a considerably lower computational cost.

Existing approaches to distributed tracking make limiting assumptions regarding the relative spatial relationship of sensors, including assuming a static sensor network or that perfect localization is available. Instead, we develop an algorithm based on the Kalman-Consensus filter for distributed tracking that properly leverages localization uncertainty in collaborative tracking. Further, our method allows the team to maintain an accurate understanding of dynamic objects in the environment by realigning robot frames and incorporating frame alignment uncertainty into our object tracking formulation. We evaluate our method in hardware on a team of three mobile ground robots tracking four people. Compared to previous works that do not account for localization error, we show that MOTLEE is resilient to localization uncertainties, enabling accurate tracking in distributed, dynamic settings with mobile tracking sensors.

However, monocular tracking and rendering of complex interaction scenarios remain challenging. In this paper, we propose Instant-NVR, a neural approach for instant volumetric human-object tracking and rendering using a single RGBD camera. It bridges traditional non-rigid tracking with recent instant radiance field techniques via a multi-thread tracking-rendering mechanism. In the tracking front-end, we adopt a robust human-object capture scheme to provide sufficient motion priors. We further introduce a separated instant neural representation with a novel hybrid deformation module for the interacting scene. We also provide an on-the-fly reconstruction scheme of the dynamic/static radiance fields via efficient motion-prior searching. Moreover, we introduce an online key frame selection scheme and a rendering-aware refinement strategy to significantly improve the appearance details for online novel-view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach for the instant generation of human-object radiance fields on the fly, notably achieving real-time photo-realistic novel view synthesis under complex human-object interactions.

Specifically, our work explores to provide a general representation to boost the temporal matching ability in various downstream tracking tasks. To achieve this, we firstly find that a simple extension of MAE, which randomly masks out frame patches in videos and reconstruct the frame pixels, heavily relies on spatial cues while ignoring temporal relations for frame reconstruction, thus leading to sub-optimal temporal matching representations. To alleviate this, we propose DropMAE, which adaptively performs spatial-attention dropout in the frame reconstruction to facilitate temporal correspondence learning in videos. We obtain several important findings with DropMAE: 1) DropMAE is a strong and efficient temporal matching learner, which achieves better fine-tuning results on matching-based tasks than the ImageNet-based MAE with 2x faster pre-training speed. 2) DropMAE is effective for different tracking tasks, i.e., object-level matching tasks including VOT and VOS, dense tracking tasks including optical flow estimation and tracking any point (TAP), and even 3D tracking in the different modality of point cloud data. Since none exists, we build ViT-based trackers for different downstream tracking tasks, and our pre-trained DropMAE model can be directly loaded in these ViT-based trackers for fine-tuning without further modifications. Experiments on 6 downstream tracking tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DropMAE as a general pre-trained representation for diverse tracking tasks.

However, existing approaches have primarily relied on appearance matching or motion modeling within only two successive frames, thereby overlooking the long-range continuous motion property of objects in 3D space. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach that views each tracklet as a continuous stream: at each timestamp, only the current frame is fed into the network to interact with multi-frame historical features stored in a memory bank, enabling efficient exploitation of sequential information. To achieve effective cross-frame message passing, a hybrid attention mechanism is designed to account for both long-range relation modeling and local geometric feature extraction. Furthermore, to enhance the utilization of multi-frame features for robust tracking, a contrastive sequence enhancement strategy is proposed, which uses ground truth tracklets to augment training sequences and promote discrimination against false positives in a contrastive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by significant margins on multiple benchmarks.

This enables capturing visual information at fine time granularities (e.g., microseconds) in rapidly changing environments. This makes event cameras highly useful for high-speed robotics tasks involving rapid motion, such as high-speed perception, object tracking, and control. However, convolutional neural network inference on event camera streams cannot currently perform real-time inference at the high speeds at which event cameras operate - current CNN inference times are typically closer in order of magnitude to the frame rates of regular frame-based cameras. Real-time inference at event camera rates is necessary to fully leverage the high frequency and high temporal resolution that event cameras offer. This paper presents EvConv, a new approach to enable fast inference on CNNs for inputs from event cameras. We observe that consecutive inputs to the CNN from an event camera have only small differences between them. Thus, we propose to perform inference on the difference between consecutive input tensors, or the increment. This enables a significant reduction in the number of floating-point operations required (and thus the inference latency) because increments are very sparse. We design EvConv to leverage the irregular sparsity in increments from event cameras and to retain the sparsity of these increments across all layers of the network. We demonstrate a reduction in the number of floating operations required in the forward pass by up to 98%. We also demonstrate a speedup of up to 1.6X for inference using CNNs for tasks such as depth estimation, object recognition, and optical flow estimation, with almost no loss in accuracy.

Typically, these observations are collected via divers, tags, and remotely-operated or human-piloted vehicles. Recently, however, autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with cameras and embedded computers with GPU capabilities are being developed for a variety of applications, and in particular, can be used to supplement these existing data collection mechanisms where human operation or tags are more difficult. Existing approaches have focused on using fully-supervised tracking methods, but labelled data for many underwater species are severely lacking. Semi-supervised trackers may offer alternative tracking solutions because they require less data than fully-supervised counterparts. However, because there are not existing realistic underwater tracking datasets, the performance of semi-supervised tracking algorithms in the marine domain is not well understood. To better evaluate their performance and utility, in this paper we provide (1) a novel dataset specific to marine animals located at http://warp.whoi.edu/vmat/, (2) an evaluation of state-of-the-art semi-supervised algorithms in the context of underwater animal tracking, and (3) an evaluation of real-world performance through demonstrations using a semi-supervised algorithm on-board an autonomous underwater vehicle to track marine animals in the wild.

Most existing approaches have ignored the online latency that can cause severe performance degradation during real-world processing. Especially for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where robust tracking is more challenging and onboard computation is limited, the latency issue can be fatal. In this work, we present a simple framework for end-to-end latency-aware tracking, i.e., end-to-end predictive visual tracking (PVT++). Unlike existing solutions that naively append Kalman Filters after trackers, PVT++ can be jointly optimized, so that it takes not only motion information but can also leverage the rich visual knowledge in most pre-trained tracker models for robust prediction. Besides, to bridge the training-evaluation domain gap, we propose a relative motion factor, empowering PVT++ to generalize to the challenging and complex UAV tracking scenes. These careful designs have made the small-capacity lightweight PVT++ a widely effective solution. Additionally, this work presents an extended latency-aware evaluation benchmark for assessing an any-speed tracker in the online setting. Empirical results on a robotic platform from the aerial perspective show that PVT++ can achieve significant performance gain on various trackers and exhibit higher accuracy than prior solutions, largely mitigating the degradation brought by latency.

Through extensive evaluation across various tracker confidence thresholds, we identify an optimal trade-off between tracking speed and accuracy, providing crucial insights for parameter fine-tuning and enhancing CTD's practicality in real-world scenarios. Our experiments across diverse detection models underscore the robustness and versatility of the CTD framework, demonstrating its potential to enable real-time tracking in resource-constrained environments.

By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction, temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations. Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames. We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability, inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical large-scale applications.

Existing systems predominantly rely on body gestures or speech to control visualizations, leaving interactions with physical objects largely underexplored. We introduce augmented physical data storytelling, an approach enabling presenters to manipulate visualizations through physical object interactions. To inform this approach, we first conducted a survey of data-driven presentations to identify common visualization commands. We then conducted workshops with nine HCI/VIS researchers to collect mappings between physical manipulations and these commands. Guided by these insights, we developed InSituTale, a prototype that combines object tracking via a depth camera with Vision-LLM for detecting real-world events. Through physical manipulations, presenters can dynamically execute various visualization commands, delivering cohesive data storytelling experiences that blend physical and digital elements. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated that InSituTale enables intuitive interactions, offers high utility, and facilitates an engaging presentation experience.

However, existing human part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3% acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was limited to parsing fixed classes.

Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability, making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

In this paper, we propose a novel form of Belief Control Barrier Functions (BCBFs) specifically designed to ensure safety in dynamic environments under stochastic dynamics and a sample-based belief about the environment state. Our approach incorporates provable concentration bounds on tail risk measures into BCBFs, effectively addressing possible multimodal and skewed belief distributions represented by samples. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates robustness against distributional shifts up to a predefined bound. We validate the effectiveness and real-time performance (approximately 1kHz) of the proposed method through two simulated underwater robotic applications: object tracking and dynamic collision avoidance.

This study focuses on developing an intelligent algorithm which can navigate a robot through a kitchen, recognizing objects, and tracking their relocation. The kitchen was chosen as the testing ground due to its dynamic nature as objects are frequently moved, rearranged and replaced. Various techniques, such as SLAM feature-based tracking and deep learning-based object detection (e.g., Faster R-CNN), are commonly used for object tracking. Additionally, methods such as optical flow analysis and 3D reconstruction have also been used to track the relocation of objects. These approaches often face challenges when it comes to problems such as lighting variations and partial occlusions, where parts of the object are hidden in some frames but visible in others. The proposed method in this study leverages the YOLOv5 architecture, initialized with pre-trained weights and subsequently fine-tuned on a custom dataset. A novel method was developed, introducing a frame-scoring algorithm which calculates a score for each object based on its location and features within all frames. This scoring approach helps to identify changes by determining the best-associated frame for each object and comparing the results in each scene, overcoming limitations seen in other methods while maintaining simplicity in design. The experimental results demonstrate an accuracy of 97.72%, a precision of 95.83% and a recall of 96.84% for this algorithm, which highlights the efficacy of the model in detecting spatial changes.

Despite the impressive performance of current 3DSOT methods, evaluating them on clean datasets inadequately reflects their comprehensive performance, as the adverse weather conditions in real-world surroundings has not been considered. One of the main obstacles is the lack of adverse weather benchmarks for the evaluation of 3DSOT. To this end, this work proposes a challenging benchmark for LiDAR-based 3DSOT in adverse weather, which comprises two synthetic datasets (KITTI-A and nuScenes-A) and one real-world dataset (CADC-SOT) spanning three weather types: rain, fog, and snow. Based on this benchmark, five representative 3D trackers from different tracking frameworks conducted robustness evaluation, resulting in significant performance degradations. This prompts the question: What are the factors that cause current advanced methods to fail on such adverse weather samples? Consequently, we explore the impacts of adverse weather and answer the above question from three perspectives: 1) target distance; 2) template shape corruption; and 3) target shape corruption. Finally, based on domain randomization and contrastive learning, we designed a dual-branch tracking framework for adverse weather, named DRCT, achieving excellent performance in benchmarks.

Most traditional multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) detection and tracking methods rely on 2D object detection, single-view multi-object tracking (MOT), and cross-view re-identification (ReID) techniques, without properly handling important 3D information by multi-view image aggregation. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection and tracking framework, named MCBLT, which first aggregates multi-view images with necessary camera calibration parameters to obtain 3D object detections in bird's-eye view (BEV). Then, we introduce hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to track these 3D detections in BEV for MTMC tracking results. Unlike existing methods, MCBLT has impressive generalizability across different scenes and diverse camera settings, with exceptional capability for long-term association handling. As a result, our proposed MCBLT establishes a new state-of-the-art on the AICity'24 dataset with $81.22$ HOTA, and on the WildTrack dataset with $95.6$ IDF1.

The dataset offers over 833 minutes (3.7M+ images) of recordings that feature 19 subjects interacting with 33 diverse rigid objects. In addition to simple pick-up, observe, and put-down actions, the subjects perform actions typical for a kitchen, office, and living room environment. The recordings include multiple synchronized data streams containing egocentric multi-view RGB/monochrome images, eye gaze signal, scene point clouds, and 3D poses of cameras, hands, and objects. The dataset is recorded with two headsets from Meta: Project Aria, which is a research prototype of AI glasses, and Quest 3, a virtual-reality headset that has shipped millions of units. Ground-truth poses were obtained by a motion-capture system using small optical markers attached to hands and objects. Hand annotations are provided in the UmeTrack and MANO formats, and objects are represented by 3D meshes with PBR materials obtained by an in-house scanner. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-view egocentric data for three popular tasks: 3D hand tracking, model-based 6DoF object pose estimation, and 3D lifting of unknown in-hand objects. The evaluated multi-view methods, whose benchmarking is uniquely enabled by HOT3D, significantly outperform their single-view counterparts.

Although Tracking-by-Detection frameworks have demonstrated excellent performance in recent years, their application in real-world scenarios faces significant challenges. Object movement in complex environments is often highly nonlinear, while existing methods typically rely on linear approximations of motion. Furthermore, system noise is frequently modeled as a Gaussian distribution, which fails to capture the true complexity of the noise dynamics. These oversimplified modeling assumptions can lead to significant reductions in tracking precision. To address this, we propose a GRU-based MOT method, which introduces a learnable Kalman filter into the motion module. This approach is able to learn object motion characteristics through data-driven learning, thereby avoiding the need for manual model design and model error. At the same time, to avoid abnormal supervision caused by the wrong association between annotations and trajectories, we design a semi-supervised learning strategy to accelerate the convergence speed and improve the robustness of the model. Evaluation experiment on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrates that our system exhibits superior performance and significant potential compared to traditional TBD methods.

Despite its wide application in robotics, autonomous driving, and smart manufacturing, there is limited literature addressing the specific challenges of running MOT on embedded devices. State-of-the-art MOT trackers designed for high-end GPUs often experience low processing rates (<11fps) when deployed on embedded devices. Existing MOT frameworks for embedded devices proposed strategies such as fusing the detector model with the feature embedding model to reduce inference latency or combining different trackers to improve tracking accuracy, but tend to compromise one for the other. This paper introduces HopTrack, a real-time multi-object tracking system tailored for embedded devices. Our system employs a novel discretized static and dynamic matching approach along with an innovative content-aware dynamic sampling technique to enhance tracking accuracy while meeting the real-time requirement. Compared with the best high-end GPU modified baseline Byte (Embed) and the best existing baseline on embedded devices MobileNet-JDE, HopTrack achieves a processing speed of up to 39.29 fps on NVIDIA AGX Xavier with a multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of up to 63.12% on the MOT16 benchmark, outperforming both counterparts by 2.15% and 4.82%, respectively. Additionally, the accuracy improvement is coupled with the reduction in energy consumption (20.8%), power (5%), and memory usage (8%), which are crucial resources on embedded devices. HopTrack is also detector agnostic allowing the flexibility of plug-and-play.

These models, despite incorporating advanced architectures like Transformer or Bird's Eye View (BEV), tend to neglect robustness in the face of challenges such as adversarial attacks, domain shifts, or data corruption. We instead focus on the robustness of the tracking models under the threat of adversarial attacks. We begin by establishing a unified framework for conducting adversarial attacks within the context of 3D object tracking, which allows us to thoroughly investigate both white-box and black-box attack strategies. For white-box attacks, we tailor specific loss functions to accommodate various tracking paradigms and extend existing methods such as FGSM, C\&W, and PGD to the point cloud domain. In addressing black-box attack scenarios, we introduce a novel transfer-based approach, the Target-aware Perturbation Generation (TAPG) algorithm, with the dual objectives of achieving high attack performance and maintaining low perceptibility. This method employs a heuristic strategy to enforce sparse attack constraints and utilizes random sub-vector factorization to bolster transferability. Our experimental findings reveal a significant vulnerability in advanced tracking methods when subjected to both black-box and white-box attacks, underscoring the necessity for incorporating robustness against adversarial attacks into the design of LiDAR point cloud tracking models. Notably, compared to existing methods, the TAPG also strikes an optimal balance between the effectiveness of the attack and the concealment of the perturbations.

Recent state-of-the-art tracking methods are founded on deep learning architectures for object detection, appearance feature extraction and track association. Despite the good tracking performance, these methods are trained and evaluated on common objects such as human and cars. To perform on the animal, there is a need to create large datasets of different types in multiple conditions. The dataset construction comprises of data collection and data annotation. In this work, we put more focus on the latter task. Particularly, we renovate the well-known tool, LabelMe, so as to assist common user with or without in-depth knowledge about computer science to annotate the data with less effort. The new tool named as TrackMe inherits the simplicity, high compatibility with varied systems, minimal hardware requirement and convenient feature utilization from the predecessor.

Here we show an in-vehicle multiple object tracking system with a flexible assignment function for tracking through multiple long-term occlusion events. To solve the flexible assignment problem formulated as a nondeterministic polynomial time-hard problem, the system relies on an embeddable Ising machine based on a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation. Using a vehicle-mountable computing platform, we demonstrate a realtime system-wide throughput (23 frames per second on average) with the enhanced functionality.

However, the existing methods based on either appearance or motion features encounter difficulties when the background is complex or the MAV is too small. In this paper, we propose a novel motion-guided MAV detector that can accurately identify small MAVs in complex and non-planar scenes. This detector first exploits a motion feature enhancement module to capture the motion features of small MAVs. Then it uses multi-object tracking and trajectory filtering to eliminate false positives caused by motion parallax. Finally, an appearance-based classifier and an appearance-based detector that operates on the cropped regions are used to achieve precise detection results. Our proposed method can effectively and efficiently detect extremely small MAVs from dynamic and complex backgrounds because it aggregates pixel-level motion features and eliminates false positives based on the motion and appearance features of MAVs. Experiments on the ARD-MAV dataset demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve high performance in small MAV detection under challenging conditions and outperform other state-of-the-art methods across various metrics

Our framework takes an unordered set of posed images captured by a monocular camera and segments fruit in each image. To make our system independent of the fruit type, we employ a foundation model that generates binary segmentation masks for any fruit. Utilizing both modalities, RGB and semantic, we train a semantic neural radiance field. Through uniform volume sampling of the implicit Fruit Field, we obtain fruit-only point clouds. By applying cascaded clustering on the extracted point cloud, our approach achieves precise fruit count.The use of neural radiance fields provides significant advantages over conventional methods such as object tracking or optical flow, as the counting itself is lifted into 3D. Our method prevents double counting fruit and avoids counting irrelevant fruit.We evaluate our methodology using both real-world and synthetic datasets. The real-world dataset consists of three apple trees with manually counted ground truths, a benchmark apple dataset with one row and ground truth fruit location, while the synthetic dataset comprises various fruit types including apple, plum, lemon, pear, peach, and mango.Additionally, we assess the performance of fruit counting using the foundation model compared to a U-Net.

The recently proposed Slot Attention module, already leveraged by several derivative works for image segmentation and object tracking in videos, is a deep learning component which performs unsupervised object-centric scene decomposition on input images. It is based on an attention architecture, in which latent slot vectors, which hold compressed information on objects, attend to localized perceptual features from the input image. In this paper, we demonstrate that design decisions on normalizing the aggregated values in the attention architecture have considerable impact on the capabilities of Slot Attention to generalize to a higher number of slots and objects as seen during training. We propose and investigate alternatives to the original normalization scheme which increase the generalization capabilities of Slot Attention to varying slot and object counts, resulting in performance gains on the task of unsupervised image segmentation. The newly proposed normalizations represent minimal and easy to implement modifications of the usual Slot Attention module, changing the value aggregation mechanism from a weighted mean operation to a scaled weighted sum operation.

In particular, we address the challenges arising from object occlusions. We propose a framework called approximate dynamic programming track (ADPTrack), which applies dynamic programming principles to improve an existing method called the base heuristic. Given a set of tracks and the next target frame, the base heuristic extends the tracks by matching them to the objects of this target frame directly. In contrast, ADPTrack first processes a few subsequent frames and applies the base heuristic starting from the next target frame to obtain tentative tracks. It then leverages the tentative tracks to match the objects of the target frame. This tends to reduce the occlusion-based errors and leads to an improvement over the base heuristic. When tested on the MOT17 video dataset, the proposed method demonstrates a 0.7% improvement in the association accuracy (IDF1 metric) over a state-of-the-art method that is used as the base heuristic. It also obtains improvements with respect to all the other standard metrics. Empirically, we found that the improvements are particularly pronounced in scenarios where the video data is obtained by fixed-position cameras.

This is a vital and challenging skill for embodied agents. However, existing methods suffer from inefficient training and poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines visual foundation models(VFM) and offline reinforcement learning(offline RL) to empower embodied visual tracking. We use a pre-trained VFM, such as "Tracking Anything", to extract semantic segmentation masks with text prompts. We then train a recurrent policy network with offline RL, e.g., Conservative Q-Learning, to learn from the collected demonstrations without online interactions. To further improve the robustness and generalization of the policy network, we also introduce a mask re-targeting mechanism and a multi-level data collection strategy. In this way, we can train a robust policy within an hour on a consumer-level GPU, e.g., Nvidia RTX 3090. We evaluate our agent on several high-fidelity environments with challenging situations, such as distraction and occlusion. The results show that our agent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency, robustness to distractors, and generalization to unseen scenarios and targets. We also demonstrate the transferability of the learned agent from virtual environments to a real-world robot.

Our key idea is that, to track a object through frames, we can obtain multiple different association results from a model by varying the frames it can observe, i.e., skipping frames in observation. As the differences in observations do not alter the identities of objects, the obtained association results should be consistent. Based on this rationale, we generate multiple observation paths, each specifying a different set of frames to be skipped, and formulate the Path Consistency Loss that enforces the association results are consistent across different observation paths. We use the proposed loss to train our object matching model with only self-supervision. By extensive experiments on three tracking datasets (MOT17, PersonPath22, KITTI), we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unsupervised methods with consistent margins on various evaluation metrics, and even achieves performance close to supervised methods.

Camera frames are processed with a state-of-the-art 3D object detector, whereas classical clustering techniques are used to process LiDAR observations. The proposed MOT algorithm comprises a three-step association process, an Extended Kalman filter for estimating the motion of each detected dynamic obstacle, and a track management phase. The EKF motion model requires the current measured relative position and orientation of the observed object and the longitudinal and angular velocities of the ego vehicle as inputs. Unlike most state-of-the-art multi-modal MOT approaches, the proposed algorithm does not rely on maps or knowledge of the ego global pose. Moreover, it uses a 3D detector exclusively for cameras and is agnostic to the type of LiDAR sensor used. The algorithm is validated both in simulation and with real-world data, with satisfactory results.

However, the existing methods concentrate more on exploring universal architectures for common categories and overlook the challenges that small objects have long been thorny due to the relative deficiency of foreground points and a low tolerance for disturbances. To this end, we propose a Siamese network-based method for small object tracking in the LiDAR point cloud, which is composed of the target-awareness prototype mining (TAPM) module and the regional grid subdivision (RGS) module. The TAPM module adopts the reconstruction mechanism of the masked decoder to learn the prototype in the feature space, aiming to highlight the presence of foreground points that will facilitate the subsequent location of small objects. Through the above prototype is capable of accentuating the small object of interest, the positioning deviation in feature maps still leads to high tracking errors. To alleviate this issue, the RGS module is proposed to recover the fine-grained features of the search region based on ViT and pixel shuffle layers. In addition, apart from the normal settings, we elaborately design a scaling experiment to evaluate the robustness of the different trackers on small objects. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the tracking performance of small targets without affecting normal-sized objects.

In this domain, computer vision has the potential to enhance the understanding of athletes' performance, but its application lags behind other sports due to limited studies and datasets. This paper makes a step forward in filling such gaps. A thorough investigation is performed on the task of skier tracking in a video capturing his/her complete performance. Obtaining continuous and accurate skier localization is preemptive for further higher-level performance analyses. To enable the study, the largest and most annotated dataset for computer vision in skiing, SkiTB, is introduced. Several visual object tracking algorithms, including both established methodologies and a newly introduced skier-optimized baseline algorithm, are tested using the dataset. The results provide valuable insights into the applicability of different tracking methods for vision-based skiing analysis.

A DVAE model is pre-trained on a single-source dataset to capture the source dynamics. Then, multiple instances of the pre-trained DVAE model are integrated into a multi-source mixture model with a discrete observation-to-source assignment latent variable. The posterior distributions of both the discrete observation-to-source assignment variable and the continuous DVAE variables representing the sources content/position are estimated using a variational expectation-maximization algorithm, leading to multi-source trajectories estimation. We illustrate the versatility of the proposed MixDVAE model on two tasks: a computer vision task, namely multi-object tracking, and an audio processing task, namely single-channel audio source separation. Experimental results show that the proposed method works well on these two tasks, and outperforms several baseline methods.

Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based visual BCIs, known for efficient speed and calibration ease, face limitations in continuous tasks due to discrete stimulus design and decoding methods. To achieve continuous control, we implemented a novel spatial encoding stimulus paradigm and devised a corresponding projection method to enable continuous modulation of decoded velocity. Subsequently, we conducted experiments involving 17 participants and achieved Fitt's ITR of 0.55 bps for the fixed tracking task and 0.37 bps for the random tracking task. The proposed BCI with a high Fitt's ITR was then integrated into two applications, including painting and gaming. In conclusion, this study proposed a visual BCI-based control method to go beyond discrete commands, allowing natural continuous control based on neural activity.

Here, we show that the kinematics of a multi-fingered robotic hand can be precisely calibrated only by moving the tips of the fingers pairwise into contact. The only prerequisite for this is sensitive contact detection, e.g., by torque-sensing in the joints (as in our DLR-Hand II) or tactile skin. The measurement function for a given joint configuration is the distance between the modeled fingertip geometries, but the actual measurement is always zero. In an in-depth analysis, we prove that this contact-based calibration determines all quantities needed for manipulating objects with the hand, i.e., the difference vectors of the fingertips, and that it is as sensitive as a calibration using an external visual tracking system and markers. We describe the complete calibration scheme, including the selection of optimal sample joint configurations and search motions for the contacts despite the initial kinematic uncertainties. In a real-world calibration experiment for the torque-controlled four-fingered DLR-Hand II, the maximal error of 17.7mm can be reduced to only 3.7mm.

While state-of-the-art methods have made remarkable progress by jointly optimizing the multi-task problems of detection and Re-ID feature learning, yet, few approaches explore to tackle the occlusion issue, which is a long-standing challenge in the MOT field. Generally, occluded objects may hinder the detector from estimating the bounding boxes, resulting in fragmented trajectories. And the learned occluded Re-ID embeddings are less distinct since they contain interferer. To this end, we propose an occlusion-aware detection and Re-ID calibrated network for multi-object tracking, termed as ORCTrack. Specifically, we propose an Occlusion-Aware Attention (OAA) module in the detector that highlights the object features while suppressing the occluded background regions. OAA can serve as a modulator that enhances the detector for some potentially occluded objects. Furthermore, we design a Re-ID embedding matching block based on the optimal transport problem, which focuses on enhancing and calibrating the Re-ID representations through different adjacent frames complementarily. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on two challenging VisDrone2021-MOT and KITTI benchmarks. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach, which can achieve new state-of-the-art performance and enjoy high run-time efficiency.

However, they are currently mostly studied separately, which results in most trajectory prediction modules being developed based on ground truth trajectories without taking into account that trajectories extracted from the detection and tracking modules in real-world scenarios are noisy. These noisy trajectories can have a significant impact on the performance of the trajectory predictor and can lead to serious prediction errors. In this paper, we build an end-to-end framework for detection, tracking, and trajectory prediction called ODTP (Online Detection, Tracking and Prediction). It adopts the state-of-the-art online multi-object tracking model, QD-3DT, for perception and trains the trajectory predictor, DCENet++, directly based on the detection results without purely relying on ground truth trajectories. We evaluate the performance of ODTP on the widely used nuScenes dataset for autonomous driving. Extensive experiments show that ODPT achieves high performance end-to-end trajectory prediction. DCENet++, with the enhanced dynamic maps, predicts more accurate trajectories than its base model. It is also more robust when compared with other generative and deterministic trajectory prediction models trained on noisy detection results.

However, systems that additionally or exclusively perceive the world from depth sensors are becoming more commonplace without any corresponding methods for object ReID. In this work, we fill the gap by providing the first large-scale study of object ReID from point clouds and establishing its performance relative to image ReID. To enable such a study, we create two large-scale ReID datasets with paired image and LiDAR observations and propose a lightweight matching head that can be concatenated to any set or sequence processing backbone (e.g., PointNet or ViT), creating a family of comparable object ReID networks for both modalities. Run in Siamese style, our proposed point cloud ReID networks can make thousands of pairwise comparisons in real-time ($10$ Hz). Our findings demonstrate that their performance increases with higher sensor resolution and approaches that of image ReID when observations are sufficiently dense. Our strongest network trained at the largest scale achieves ReID accuracy exceeding $90\%$ for rigid objects and $85\%$ for deformable objects (without any explicit skeleton normalization). To our knowledge, we are the first to study object re-identification from real point cloud observations.

In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{TCOW}$, a new benchmark and model for visual tracking through heavy occlusion and containment. We set up a task where the goal is to, given a video sequence, segment both the projected extent of the target object, as well as the surrounding container or occluder whenever one exists. To study this task, we create a mixture of synthetic and annotated real datasets to support both supervised learning and structured evaluation of model performance under various forms of task variation, such as moving or nested containment. We evaluate two recent transformer-based video models and find that while they can be surprisingly capable of tracking targets under certain settings of task variation, there remains a considerable performance gap before we can claim a tracking model to have acquired a true notion of object permanence.

Previous approaches either grasp or push an object and then obtain the segmentation mask of the grasped or pushed object after one action. Instead, our system defers the decision on segmenting objects after a sequence of robot pushing actions. By applying multi-object tracking and video object segmentation on the images collected via robot pushing, our system can generate segmentation masks of all the objects in these images in a self-supervised way. These include images where objects are very close to each other, and segmentation errors usually occur on these images for existing object segmentation networks. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system by fine-tuning segmentation networks trained on synthetic data with real-world data collected by our system. We show that, after fine-tuning, the segmentation accuracy of the networks is significantly improved both in the same domain and across different domains. In addition, we verify that the fine-tuned networks improve top-down robotic grasping of unseen objects in the real world.

However, when visual tracking fails, VIO algorithms quickly diverge due to rapid error accumulation during inertial data integration. This error is typically modeled as a combination of additive Gaussian noise and a slowly changing bias which evolves as a random walk. In this work, we propose to train a neural network to learn the true bias evolution. We implement and compare two common sequential deep learning architectures: LSTMs and Transformers. Our approach follows from recent learning-based inertial estimators, but, instead of learning a motion model, we target IMU bias explicitly, which allows us to generalize to locomotion patterns unseen in training. We show that our proposed method improves state estimation in visually challenging situations across a wide range of motions by quadrupedal robots, walking humans, and drones. Our experiments show an average 15% reduction in drift rate, with much larger reductions when there is total vision failure. Importantly, we also demonstrate that models trained with one locomotion pattern (human walking) can be applied to another (quadruped robot trotting) without retraining.

In this work, we propose a radically novel one-stream network with the strength of the instance-level encoding, which avoids the correlation operations occurring in previous Siamese network, thus considerably reducing the computational effort. In particular, the proposed method mainly consists of a Template-aware Transformer Module (TTM) and a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation (MFA) module capable of fusing spatial and semantic information. The TTM stitches the specified template and the search region together and leverages an attention mechanism to establish the information flow, breaking the previous pattern of independent \textit{extraction-and-correlation}. As a result, this module makes it possible to directly generate template-aware features that are suitable for the arbitrary and continuously changing nature of the target, enabling the model to deal with unseen categories. In addition, the MFA is proposed to make spatial and semantic information complementary to each other, which is characterized by reverse directional feature propagation that aggregates information from shallow to deep layers. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes demonstrate that our method has achieved considerable performance not only for class-specific tracking but also for class-agnostic tracking with less computation and higher efficiency.

However, the existing methods based on deep neural networks focus mainly on training different models for different categories, which makes them unable to perform well in real-world applications when encountering classes unseen during the training phase. In this work, we investigate a more challenging task in the LiDAR point clouds, class-agnostic tracking, where a general model is supposed to be learned for any specified targets of both observed and unseen categories. In particular, we first investigate the class-agnostic performances of the state-of-the-art trackers via exposing the unseen categories to them during testing, finding that a key factor for class-agnostic tracking is how to constrain fused features between the template and search region to maintain generalization when the distribution is shifted from observed to unseen classes. Therefore, we propose a feature decorrelation method to address this problem, which eliminates the spurious correlations of the fused features through a set of learned weights and further makes the search region consistent among foreground points and distinctive between foreground and background points. Experiments on the KITTI and NuScenes demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve considerable improvements by benchmarking against the advanced trackers P2B and BAT, especially when tracking unseen objects.

This paper begins by comparing different definitions of functional derivatives and exploring their relationships and implications for practical applications. It then proposes a rigorous definition of the functional derivative, utilizing straightforward yet precise mathematics for clarity.

However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only 35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV systems.

In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.

Recent research has benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However, these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted advancements on this task.

However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. The code will be released.

Multi-camera setups have been used to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive coverage of the scene. Recent multi-view pedestrian detection models have highlighted the potential of an early-fusion strategy, projecting feature maps of all views to a common ground plane or the Bird's Eye View (BEV), and then performing detection. This strategy has been shown to improve both detection and tracking performance. However, the perspective transformation results in significant distortion on the ground plane, affecting the robustness of the appearance features of the pedestrians. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel model that incorporates attention mechanisms in a multi-view pedestrian tracking scenario. Our model utilizes an early-fusion strategy for detection, and a cross-attention mechanism to establish robust associations between pedestrians in different frames, while efficiently propagating pedestrian features across frames, resulting in a more robust feature representation for each pedestrian. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models, with an IDF1 score of $96.1\%$ on Wildtrack dataset, and $85.7\%$ on MultiviewX dataset.

Therefore, its implementation on low-power and real-time embedded platforms is highly desirable. Modern MOT algorithms should be able to track objects of a given class (e.g. people or vehicles). In addition, the number of objects to be tracked is not known in advance, and they may appear and disappear at any time, as well as be obscured. For these reasons, the most popular and successful approaches have recently been based on the tracking paradigm. Therefore, the presence of a high quality object detector is essential, which in practice accounts for the vast majority of the computational and memory complexity of the whole MOT system. In this paper, we propose an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) implementation of an embedded MOT system based on a quantized YOLOv8 detector and the SORT (Simple Online Realtime Tracker) tracker. We use a modified version of the FINN framework to utilize external memory for model parameters and to support operations necessary required by YOLOv8. We discuss the evaluation of detection and tracking performance using the COCO and MOT15 datasets, where we achieve 0.21 mAP and 38.9 MOTA respectively. As the computational platform, we use an MPSoC system (Zynq UltraScale+ device from AMD/Xilinx) where the detector is deployed in reprogrammable logic and the tracking algorithm is implemented in the processor system.

This is further complicated by frequent occurrences of mutual occlusions among objects, which can lead to tracking errors and reduced performance in existing methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel adaptive key frame mining strategy that addresses the limitations of current tracking approaches. Specifically, we introduce a Key Frame Extraction (KFE) module that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively segment videos, thereby guiding the tracker to exploit the intrinsic logic of the video content. This approach allows us to capture structured spatial relationships between different objects as well as the temporal relationships of objects across frames. To tackle the issue of object occlusions, we have developed an Intra-Frame Feature Fusion (IFF) module. Unlike traditional graph-based methods that primarily focus on inter-frame feature fusion, our IFF module uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to facilitate information exchange between the target and surrounding objects within a frame. This innovation significantly enhances target distinguishability and mitigates tracking loss and appearance similarity due to occlusions. By combining the strengths of both long and short trajectories and considering the spatial relationships between objects, our proposed tracker achieves impressive results on the MOT17 dataset, i.e., 68.6 HOTA, 81.0 IDF1, 66.6 AssA, and 893 IDS, proving its effectiveness and accuracy.

This intricate task involves the reasoning of linguistic and visual modalities, along with the temporal association of target objects. However, the seminal work employs only loose feature fusion and overlooks the utilization of long-term information on tracked objects. In this study, we introduce a compact Transformer-based method, termed TenRMOT. We conduct feature fusion at both encoding and decoding stages to fully exploit the advantages of Transformer architecture. Specifically, we incrementally perform cross-modal fusion layer-by-layer during the encoding phase. In the decoding phase, we utilize language-guided queries to probe memory features for accurate prediction of the desired objects. Moreover, we introduce a query update module that explicitly leverages temporal prior information of the tracked objects to enhance the consistency of their trajectories. In addition, we introduce a novel task called Referring Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (RMOTS) and construct a new dataset named Ref-KITTI Segmentation. Our dataset consists of 18 videos with 818 expressions, and each expression averages 10.7 masks, which poses a greater challenge compared to the typical single mask in most existing referring video segmentation datasets. TenRMOT demonstrates superior performance on both the referring multi-object tracking and the segmentation tasks.

In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.

We initially detect instance-wise keypoints with a YOLOv8s model to compute 6D pose estimates of known objects by solving PnP. We use a ray tracing approach to track a geometric scene graph consisting of mesh models of object instances. In contrast to classical point-to-point matching, this leads to more robust results, especially under occlusions between objects instances. We show that using this hybrid strategy leads to robust self-localization, pre-segmentation of the range sensor data and accurate pose tracking of objects using the same environmental representation. All detected objects are integrated into a semantic scene graph. This scene graph then serves as a front end to a semantic mapping framework to allow spatial reasoning.

Despite demonstrated success, such networks suffer from some fundamental problems: 1) It contains pooling operation to cope with inherently disordered point clouds, hindering the capture of 3D spatial information that is useful for tracking, a regression task. 2) The adopted set abstraction operation hardly handles density-inconsistent point clouds, also preventing 3D spatial information from being modeled. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel tracking framework, termed VoxelTrack. By voxelizing inherently disordered point clouds into 3D voxels and extracting their features via sparse convolution blocks, VoxelTrack effectively models precise and robust 3D spatial information, thereby guiding accurate position prediction for tracked objects. Moreover, VoxelTrack incorporates a dual-stream encoder with cross-iterative feature fusion module to further explore fine-grained 3D spatial information for tracking. Benefiting from accurate 3D spatial information being modeled, our VoxelTrack simplifies tracking pipeline with a single regression loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely-adopted datasets including KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset. The experimental results confirm that VoxelTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance (88.3%, 71.4% and 63.6% mean precision on the three datasets, respectively), and outperforms the existing trackers with a real-time speed of 36 Fps on a single TITAN RTX GPU. The source code and model will be released.

Generally, the two tasks are handled separately in traditional paradigms and a few methods have started to explore modeling these two tasks in a joint manner recently. However, these approaches suffer from the limitations of single-frame training and inconsistent coordinate representations between tracking and prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a streaming and unified framework for joint 3D Multi-Object Tracking and trajectory Prediction (StreamMOTP) to address the above challenges. Firstly, we construct the model in a streaming manner and exploit a memory bank to preserve and leverage the long-term latent features for tracked objects more effectively. Secondly, a relative spatio-temporal positional encoding strategy is introduced to bridge the gap of coordinate representations between the two tasks and maintain the pose-invariance for trajectory prediction. Thirdly, we further improve the quality and consistency of predicted trajectories with a dual-stream predictor. We conduct extensive experiments on popular nuSences dataset and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of StreamMOTP, which outperforms previous methods significantly on both tasks. Furthermore, we also prove that the proposed framework has great potential and advantages in actual applications of autonomous driving.

One approach for detecting and tracking surrounding traffic participants is the combination of a learning based object detector with a classical tracking algorithm. Learning based object detectors have been shown to work adequately on lidar and camera data, while learning based object detectors using standard radar data input have proven to be inferior. Recently, with the improvements to radar sensor technology in the form of imaging radars, the object detection performance on radar was greatly improved but is still limited compared to lidar sensors due to the sparsity of the radar point cloud. This presents a unique challenge for the task of multi-object tracking. The tracking algorithm must overcome the limited detection quality while generating consistent tracks. To this end, a comparison between different multi-object tracking methods on imaging radar data is required to investigate its potential for downstream tasks. The work at hand compares multiple approaches and analyzes their limitations when applied to imaging radar data. Furthermore, enhancements to the presented approaches in the form of probabilistic association algorithms are considered for this task.

Recently, multi-object tracking in various practical use cases have received much attention, but multi-object tracking in dark scenes is rarely considered. In this paper, we focus on multi-object tracking in dark scenes. To address the lack of datasets, we first build a Low-light Multi-Object Tracking (LMOT) dataset. LMOT provides well-aligned low-light video pairs captured by our dual-camera system, and high-quality multi-object tracking annotations for all videos. Then, we propose a low-light multi-object tracking method, termed as LTrack. We introduce the adaptive low-pass downsample module to enhance low-frequency components of images outside the sensor noises. The degradation suppression learning strategy enables the model to learn invariant information under noise disturbance and image quality degradation. These components improve the robustness of multi-object tracking in dark scenes. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of our LMOT dataset and proposed LTrack. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and its competitiveness in real night low-light scenes. Dataset and Code: https: //github.com/ying-fu/LMOT

Mainstream approaches encompass rule-based and deep learning-based methods for spatio-temporal relationship modeling. While the former relies on physical motion laws, offering wider applicability but yielding suboptimal results for complex object movements, the latter, though achieving high-performance, lacks interpretability and involves complex module designs. This work aims to simplify deep learning-based spatio-temporal relationship models and introduce interpretability into features for data association. Specifically, a lightweight single-layer transformer encoder is utilized to model spatio-temporal relationships. To make features more interpretative, two contrastive regularization losses based on representation alignment are proposed, derived from spatio-temporal consistency rules. By applying weighted summation to affinity matrices, the aligned features can seamlessly integrate into the data association stage of the original tracking workflow. Experimental results showcase that our model enhances the majority of existing tracking networks' performance without excessive complexity, with minimal increase in training overhead and nearly negligible computational and storage costs.

A nonlinear filter for this model is implemented using the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and tested using the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. The proposed solution yields promising results in 3D while maintaining perfect results when projected into the 2D image. Moreover, the estimation error covariance matches the true one. Unlike conventional methods, the introduced model parameters have convenient meaning and can readily be adjusted for a problem.

Existing video dialog models struggle with questions requiring both spatial and temporal localization within videos, long-term temporal reasoning, and accurate object tracking across multiple dialog turns. OLViT addresses these challenges by maintaining a global dialog state based on the output of an Object State Tracker (OST) and a Language State Tracker (LST): while the OST attends to the most important objects within the video, the LST keeps track of the most important linguistic co-references to previous dialog turns. In stark contrast to previous works, our approach is generic by nature and is therefore capable of learning continuous multi-modal dialog state representations of the most relevant objects and rounds. As a result, they can be seamlessly integrated into Large Language Models (LLMs) and offer high flexibility in dealing with different datasets and tasks. Evaluations on the challenging DVD (response classification) and SIMMC 2.1 (response generation) datasets show that OLViT achieves new state-of-the-art performance across both datasets.

This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture, using conditional latent diffusion models, the Latent Diffusion Track (LDTrack), for tracking multiple dynamic people under intraclass variations. By uniquely utilizing conditional latent diffusion models to capture temporal person embeddings, our architecture can adapt to appearance changes of people over time. We incorporated a latent feature encoder network which enables the diffusion process to operate within a high-dimensional latent space to allow for the extraction and spatial-temporal refinement of such rich features as person appearance, motion, location, identity, and contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LDTrack over other state-of-the-art tracking methods in cluttered and crowded human-centered environments under intraclass variations. Namely, the results show our method outperforms existing deep learning robotic people tracking methods in both tracking accuracy and tracking precision with statistical significance. Additionally, a comprehensive multi-object tracking comparison study was performed against the state-of-the-art methods in urban environments, demonstrating the generalizability of LDTrack. An ablation study was performed to validate the design choices of LDTrack.

However, such over-specialized model designs incur redundant parameters, thus limiting the broader applicability of 3D SOT task. This paper first introduces unified models that can simultaneously track objects across all categories using a single network with shared model parameters. Specifically, we propose to explicitly encode distinct attributes associated to different object categories, enabling the model to adapt to cross-category data. We find that the attribute variances of point cloud objects primarily occur from the varying size and shape (e.g., large and square vehicles v.s. small and slender humans). Based on this observation, we design a novel point set representation learning network inheriting transformer architecture, termed AdaFormer, which adaptively encodes the dynamically varying shape and size information from cross-category data in a unified manner. We further incorporate the size and shape prior derived from the known template targets into the model's inputs and learning objective, facilitating the learning of unified representation. Equipped with such designs, we construct two category-unified models SiamCUT and MoCUT.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SiamCUT and MoCUT exhibit strong generalization and training stability. Furthermore, our category-unified models outperform the category-specific counterparts by a significant margin (e.g., on KITTI dataset, 12% and 3% performance gains on the Siamese and motion paradigms). Our code will be available.

While existing state-of-the-art methods have demonstrated success in reconstructing non-rigid objects using neural field representations, conventional feed-forward networks encounter challenges with ambiguous observations from noisy, partial, or sparse point clouds. To address these challenges, we introduce a diffusion model that explicitly learns the shape and motion distribution of non-rigid objects through an iterative denoising process of compressed latent representations. The diffusion-based priors enable more plausible and probabilistic reconstructions when handling ambiguous inputs. We parameterize 4D dynamics with latent sets instead of using global latent codes. This novel 4D representation allows us to learn local shape and deformation patterns, leading to more accurate non-linear motion capture and significantly improving generalizability to unseen motions and identities. For more temporally-coherent object tracking, we synchronously denoise deformation latent sets and exchange information across multiple frames. To avoid computational overhead, we designed an interleaved space and time attention block to alternately aggregate deformation latents along spatial and temporal domains. Extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our Motion2VecSets in 4D reconstruction from various imperfect observations.

Existing approaches are mostly based on offline supervised training strategies. This leads to the delay of the model deployment and the obtained filters are susceptible to distribution shift of test-time data. In this paper, we propose an online learning framework for differentiable particle filters so that model parameters can be updated as data arrive. The technical constraint is that there is no known ground truth state information in the online inference setting. We address this by adopting an unsupervised loss to construct the online model updating procedure, which involves a sequence of filtering operations for online maximum likelihood-based parameter estimation. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and compare it with supervised learning methods in simulation settings including a multivariate linear Gaussian state-space model and a simulated object tracking experiment.

ByteTrack, a simple tracking algorithm, enables the simultaneous tracking of multiple objects by strategically incorporating detections with a low confidence threshold. Conventionally, objects are initially associated with high confidence threshold detections. When the association between objects and detections becomes ambiguous, ByteTrack extends the association to lower confidence threshold detections. One notable drawback of the existing ByteTrack approach is its reliance on a fixed threshold to differentiate between high and low-confidence detections. In response to this limitation, we introduce a novel and adaptive approach. Our proposed method entails a dynamic adjustment of the confidence threshold, leveraging insights derived from overall detections. Through experimentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive confidence threshold technique while maintaining running time compared to ByteTrack.

The hyperspectral image, with its many bands, provides a rich source of material information of an object that can be effectively used for object tracking. While most hyperspectral trackers are based on detection-based techniques, no one has yet attempted to employ YOLO for detecting and tracking the object. This is due to the presence of multiple spectral bands, the scarcity of annotated hyperspectral videos, and YOLO's performance limitation in managing occlusions, and distinguishing object in cluttered backgrounds. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework called Hy-Tracker, which aims to bridge the gap between hyperspectral data and state-of-the-art object detection methods to leverage the strengths of YOLOv7 for object tracking in hyperspectral videos. Hy-Tracker not only introduces YOLOv7 but also innovatively incorporates a refined tracking module on top of YOLOv7. The tracker refines the initial detections produced by YOLOv7, leading to improved object-tracking performance. Furthermore, we incorporate Kalman-Filter into the tracker, which addresses the challenges posed by scale variation and occlusion. The experimental results on hyperspectral benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Hy-Tracker in accurately tracking objects across frames.

For this reason, in this paper, we present ViKi-HyCo (Visual Servoing and Kinematic Hybrid-Controller). This approach generates the necessary maneuvers for the complex positioning of a non-holonomic mobile robot in outdoor environments. In this method, we use \hbox{LiDAR-camera} fusion to estimate objects bounding boxes using image and metrics modalities. With the multi-modality nature of our representation, we can automatically obtain a target for a visual servoing controller. At the same time, we also have a metric target, which allows us to hybridize with a kinematic controller. Given this hybridization, we can perform complex maneuvers even when the target is far away from the camera's FOV. The proposed approach does not require an object-tracking algorithm and can be applied to any robotic positioning task where its kinematic model is known. ViKi-HyCo has an error of 0.0428 \pm 0.0467 m in the X-axis and 0.0515 \pm 0.0323 m in the Y-axis at the end of a complete positioning task.

It is a challenging and fundamental problem for robotics. In precision agriculture the challenge of achieving a satisfactory solution is amplified by extreme camera motion, sudden illumination changes, and strong occlusions. Most modern trackers rely on the appearance of objects rather than motion for association, which can be ineffective when most targets are static objects with the same appearance, as in the agricultural case. To this end, on the trail of SORT [5], we propose AgriSORT, a simple, online, real-time tracking-by-detection pipeline for precision agriculture based only on motion information that allows for accurate and fast propagation of tracks between frames. The main focuses of AgriSORT are efficiency, flexibility, minimal dependencies, and ease of deployment on robotic platforms. We test the proposed pipeline on a novel MOT benchmark specifically tailored for the agricultural context, based on video sequences taken in a table grape vineyard, particularly challenging due to strong self-similarity and density of the instances. Both the code and the dataset are available for future comparisons.

The goal is to predict an object's track in geospatial coordinates along with uncertainty over the object's location while respecting communication constraints that prohibit centralizing raw image data. We present a novel single-object geospatial tracking data set that includes high-accuracy ground truth object locations and video data from a network of four cameras. We present a modeling framework for addressing this task including a novel backbone model and explore how uncertainty calibration and fine-tuning through a differentiable tracker affect performance.

Large sizes of such models do not allow their deployment in low-power conditions and designing compressed variants of large tracking models is of great importance. This paper demonstrates how highly compressed light-weight object trackers can be designed using neural architectural pruning of large CNN and transformer based trackers. Further, a comparative study on architectural choices best suited to design light-weight trackers is provided. A comparison between SOTA trackers using CNNs, transformers as well as the combination of the two is presented to study their stability at various compression ratios. Finally results for extreme pruning scenarios going as low as 1% in some cases are shown to study the limits of network pruning in object tracking. This work provides deeper insights into designing highly efficient trackers from existing SOTA methods.

Recent developments in deep learning have pushed the performance of image OD to new heights by learning-based, data-driven approaches. On the other hand, video OD remains less explored, mostly due to much more expensive data annotation needs. At the same time, multi-object tracking (MOT) which requires reasoning about track identities and spatio-temporal trajectories, shares similar spirits with video OD. However, most MOT datasets are class-specific (e.g., person-annotated only), which constrains a model's flexibility to perform tracking on other objects. We propose TrIVD (Tracking and Image-Video Detection), the first framework that unifies image OD, video OD, and MOT within one end-to-end model. To handle the discrepancies and semantic overlaps of category labels across datasets, TrIVD formulates detection/tracking as grounding and reasons about object categories via visual-text alignments. The unified formulation enables cross-dataset, multi-task training, and thus equips TrIVD with the ability to leverage frame-level features, video-level spatio-temporal relations, as well as track identity associations. With such joint training, we can now extend the knowledge from OD data, that comes with much richer object category annotations, to MOT and achieve zero-shot tracking capability. Experiments demonstrate that multi-task co-trained TrIVD outperforms single-task baselines across all image/video OD and MOT tasks. We further set the first baseline on the new task of zero-shot tracking.

To address this issue, partial binarization techniques have been developed, but a systematic approach to mixing binary and full-precision parameters in a single network is still lacking. In this paper, we propose a controlled approach to partial binarization, creating a budgeted binary neural network (B2NN) with our MixBin strategy. This method optimizes the mixing of binary and full-precision components, allowing for explicit selection of the fraction of the network to remain binary. Our experiments show that B2NNs created using MixBin outperform those from random or iterative searches and state-of-the-art layer selection methods by up to 3% on the ImageNet-1K dataset. We also show that B2NNs outperform the structured pruning baseline by approximately 23% at the extreme FLOP budget of 15%, and perform well in object tracking, with up to a 12.4% relative improvement over other baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate that B2NNs developed by MixBin can be transferred across datasets, with some cases showing improved performance over directly applying MixBin on the downstream data.

Articulated objects often come with unexpected articulation mechanisms that are inconsistent with categorical priors: for example, a drawer might rotate about a hinge joint instead of sliding open. We propose a category-independent framework for predicting the articulation models of unknown objects from sequences of RGB-D images. The prediction is performed by a two-step process: first, a visual perception module tracks object part poses from raw images, and second, a factor graph takes these poses and infers the articulation model including the current configuration between the parts as a 6D twist. We also propose a manipulation-oriented metric to evaluate predicted joint twists in terms of how well a compliant robot controller would be able to manipulate the articulated object given the predicted twist. We demonstrate that our visual perception and factor graph modules outperform baselines on simulated data and show the applicability of our factor graph on real world data.

Our approach to it involves a team of cooperating micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) with on-board cameras only. The key enabling-aspect of our approach is the on-board person detection and tracking method. Recent state-of-the-art methods based on deep neural networks (DNN) are highly promising in this context. However, real time DNNs are severely constrained in input data dimensions, in contrast to available camera resolutions. Therefore, DNNs often fail at objects with small scale or far away from the camera, which are typical characteristics of a scenario with aerial robots. Thus, the core problem addressed in this paper is how to achieve on-board, real-time, continuous and accurate vision-based detections using DNNs for visual person tracking through MAVs. Our solution leverages cooperation among multiple MAVs. First, each MAV fuses its own detections with those obtained by other MAVs to perform cooperative visual tracking. This allows for predicting future poses of the tracked person, which are used to selectively process only the relevant regions of future images, even at high resolutions. Consequently, using our DNN-based detector we are able to continuously track even distant humans with high accuracy and speed. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through real robot experiments involving two aerial robots tracking a person, while maintaining an active perception-driven formation. Our solution runs fully on-board our MAV's CPU and GPU, with no remote processing. ROS-based source code is provided for the benefit of the community.

To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference.

Extracting and utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras. The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm. Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate, typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

Then, we introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics. Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of large-scale pretrained models in this field.

We aim to bring that technology to field operators in the field who require flexible, high-performance edge AI system that can be adapted on a moment's notice. This paper introduces CHAMP (Configurable Hot-swappable Architecture for Machine Perception), a modular edge computing platform that allows operators to dynamically swap in specialized AI "capability cartridges" for tasks like face recognition, object tracking, and document analysis. CHAMP leverages low-power FPGA-based accelerators on a high-throughput bus, orchestrated by a custom operating system (VDiSK) to enable plug-and-play AI pipelines and cryptographically secured biometric datasets. In this paper we describe the CHAMP design, including its modular scaling with multiple accelerators and the VDiSK operating system for runtime reconfiguration, along with its cryptographic capabilities to keep data stored on modules safe and private. Experiments demonstrate near-linear throughput scaling from 1 to 5 neural compute accelerators, highlighting both the performance gains and saturation limits of the USB3-based bus. Finally, we discuss applications of CHAMP in field biometrics, surveillance, and disaster response, and outline future improvements in bus protocols, cartridge capabilities, and system software.

This work addresses two pivotal challenges, namely, the implementation and the orchestration of the migration process. We first introduce a novel framework that efficiently implements stateful migration and effectively orchestrates the migration process by fulfilling both network and application KPI targets. Through experimental validation using realistic microservices, we then show that our solution (i) greatly improves migration performance, yielding up to 77% decrease of the migration downtime with respect to the state of the art, and (ii) successfully addresses the strict user QoE requirements of critical scenarios featuring latency-sensitive microservices. Further, we consider two practical use cases, featuring, respectively, a UAV autopilot microservice and a multi-object tracking task, and demonstrate how our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in configuring the migration process and in meeting KPI targets.

Purely vision-based tracking often suffers from heavy occlusions due to the frequent contact interactions and motion blur caused by abrupt motion during contact impacts. We propose TwinTrack, a physics-aware visual tracking framework that enables robust and real-time 6-DoF pose tracking of unknown dynamic objects in a contact-rich scene by leveraging the contact physics of the observed scene. At the core of TwinTrack is an integration of Real2Sim and Sim2Real. In Real2Sim, we combine the complementary strengths of vision and contact physics to estimate object's collision geometry and physical properties: object's geometry is first reconstructed from vision, then updated along with other physical parameters from contact dynamics for physical accuracy. In Sim2Real, robust pose estimation of the object is achieved by adaptive fusion between visual tracking and prediction of the learned contact physics. TwinTrack is built on a GPU-accelerated, deeply customized physics engine to ensure real-time performance. We evaluate our method on two contact-rich scenarios: object falling with rich contact impacts against the environment, and contact-rich in-hand manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, TwinTrack achieves significantly more robust, accurate, and real-time 6-DoF tracking in these challenging scenarios, with tracking speed exceeding 20 Hz.

However, existing studies rarely address genuinely free-viewpoint MVMOT systems, which could significantly enhance the flexibility and scalability of cooperative tracking systems. To bridge this gap, we first construct the Multi-Drone Multi-Object Tracking (MDMOT) dataset, captured by mobile drone swarms across diverse real-world scenarios, initially establishing the first benchmark for multi-object tracking in arbitrary multi-view environment. Building upon this foundation, we propose \textbf{FusionTrack}, an end-to-end framework that reasonably integrates tracking and re-identification to leverage multi-view information for robust trajectory association.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and deep learning technology, visual-based interaction has gradually replaced traditional input devices and become an important way for intelligent systems to interact with users. The DeepSORT algorithm can achieve accurate target tracking in dynamic environments by combining Kalman filters and deep learning feature extraction methods. It is especially suitable for complex scenes with multi-target tracking and fast movements. This study experimentally verifies the superior performance of DeepSORT in gesture recognition and tracking. It can accurately capture and track the user's gesture trajectory and is superior to traditional tracking methods in terms of real-time and accuracy. In addition, this study also combines gesture recognition experiments to evaluate the recognition ability and feedback response of the DeepSORT algorithm under different gestures (such as sliding, clicking, and zooming). The experimental results show that DeepSORT can not only effectively deal with target occlusion and motion blur but also can stably track in a multi-target environment, achieving a smooth user interaction experience. Finally, this paper looks forward to the future development direction of intelligent human-computer interaction systems based on visual tracking and proposes future research focuses such as algorithm optimization, data fusion, and multimodal interaction in order to promote a more intelligent and personalized interactive experience.

Besides that, query denoising can be used to increase the diversity of training samples for modeling complex scenarios which is critical for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), showing its potential in MOT application. Existing approaches integrate query denoising within the tracking-by-attention paradigm. However, as the denoising process only happens within the single frame, it cannot benefit the tracker to learn temporal-related information. In addition, the attention mask in query denoising prevents information exchange between denoising and object queries, limiting its potential in improving association using self-attention. To address these issues, we propose TQD-Track, which introduces Temporal Query Denoising (TQD) tailored for MOT, enabling denoising queries to carry temporal information and instance-specific feature representation. We introduce diverse noise types onto denoising queries that simulate real-world challenges in MOT. We analyze our proposed TQD for different tracking paradigms, and find out the paradigm with explicit learned data association module, e.g. tracking-by-detection or alternating detection and association, benefit from TQD by a larger margin. For these paradigms, we further design an association mask in the association module to ensure the consistent interaction between track and detection queries as during inference. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances different tracking methods by only changing the training process, especially the paradigms with explicit association module.

With the advancement of 3D sensors, these systems can better perceive their surroundings using effective 3D Extended Object Tracking (EOT) methods. Based on the observation that common road users are symmetrical on the right and left sides in the traveling direction, we focus on the side view profile of the object. In order to leverage of the development in 2D EOT and balance the number of parameters of a shape model in the tracking algorithms, we propose a method for 3D extended object tracking (EOT) by describing the side view profile of the object with B-spline curves and forming an extrusion to obtain a 3D extent. The use of B-spline curves exploits their flexible representation power by allowing the control points to move freely. The algorithm is developed into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). For a through evaluation of this method, we use simulated traffic scenario of different vehicle models and realworld open dataset containing both radar and lidar data.

A variety of 2D and 3D MOD and MOT methods have been developed for monocular and stereo cameras. Road safety analysis can benefit from those advancements. As crashes are rare events, surrogate measures of safety (SMoS) have been developed for safety analyses. (Semi-)Automated safety analysis methods extract road user trajectories to compute safety indicators, for example, Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Post-encroachment Time (PET). Inspired by the success of deep learning in MOD and MOT, we investigate three MOT methods, including one based on a stereo-camera, using the annotated KITTI traffic video dataset. Two post-processing steps, IDsplit and SS, are developed to improve the tracking results and investigate the factors influencing the TTC. The experimental results show that, despite some advantages in terms of the numbers of interactions or similarity to the TTC distributions, all the tested methods systematically over-estimate the number of interactions and under-estimate the TTC: they report more interactions and more severe interactions, making the road user interactions appear less safe than they are. Further efforts will be directed towards testing more methods and more data, in particular from roadside sensors, to verify the results and improve the performance.

The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

Precise identification of these properties is essential to manipulate objects in a stable and controlled way, and is also required to anticipate the outcomes of (prehensile or non-prehensile) manipulation actions such as pushing, pulling, lifting, etc. Our study focuses on autonomously inferring the physical properties of a diverse set of various homogeneous, heterogeneous, and articulated objects utilizing a robotic system equipped with vision and tactile sensors. We propose a novel predictive perception framework for identifying object properties of the diverse objects by leveraging versatile exploratory actions: non-prehensile pushing and prehensile pulling. As part of the framework, we propose a novel active shape perception to seamlessly initiate exploration. Our innovative dual differentiable filtering with Graph Neural Networks learns the object-robot interaction and performs consistent inference of indirectly observable time-invariant object properties. In addition, we formulate a $N$-step information gain approach to actively select the most informative actions for efficient learning and inference. Extensive real-robot experiments with planar objects show that our predictive perception framework results in better performance than the state-of-the-art baseline and demonstrate our framework in three major applications for i) object tracking, ii) goal-driven task, and iii) change in environment detection.

While TBD is decoupled and efficient, its fragmented association steps and heuristic matching pipelines often compromise robustness in complex scenarios. TBQ provides stronger semantic modeling through end-to-end learning, but suffers from high training cost and slow inference due to tight coupling between detection and association. To address these challenges, we propose TBDQ-Net, a unified tracking-by-detection-and-query (TBDQ) framework that effectively combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method efficiently integrates pretrained, high-performance detectors with an MOT-tailored associator. The associator is lightweight and directly fetches information from the inference of detectors, enhancing the overall efficiency of the framework. The associator is also learnable, making it essential for fully end-to-end optimization, ensuring robust tracking capabilities. Specifically, the associator comprises two key modules: basic information interaction (BII) for comprehensive semantic interaction, and content-position alignment (CPA) for semantic and positional consistency. TBDQ-Net's effectiveness is extensively demonstrated on DanceTrack, SportsMOT and MOT20 benchmarks. As a structurally efficient and semantically robust tracking framework, it outperforms the leading TBD method by 6.0 IDF1 points on DanceTrack and achieves at least 37.5% faster inference than prominent TBQ methods.

Such limitations can be exacerbated by nonlinear object motion, particularly from an ego-centric viewpoint. It becomes evident that to address these challenges, the key lies in exploiting temporal feature relation over an extended horizon and enforcing spatial motion consistency for effective association. To this end, this paper proposes SIRA (Scalable Inter-frame Relation and Association) with two designs. First, inspired by Swin Transformer, we introduce extended temporal relation, generalizing the existing temporal relation layer from two consecutive frames to multiple inter-frames with temporally regrouped window attention for scalability. Second, we propose motion consistency track with the concept of a pseudo-tracklet generated from observational data for better trajectory prediction and subsequent object association. Our approach achieves 58.11 mAP@0.5 for oriented object detection and 47.79 MOTA for multiple object tracking on the Radiate dataset, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by a margin of +4.11 mAP@0.5 and +9.94 MOTA, respectively.

Typically, these trackers employ optimally pre-trained deep networks to represent all diverse objects with multi-channel features from some fixed layers. The deep networks employed are usually trained to extract rich knowledge from massive data used in object classification and so they are capable to represent generic objects very well. However, these networks are too complex to represent a specific moving object, leading to poor generalization as well as high computational and memory costs. This paper presents a novel and general framework termed channel distillation to facilitate deep trackers. To validate the effectiveness of channel distillation, we take discriminative correlation filter (DCF) and ECO for example. We demonstrate that an integrated formulation can turn feature compression, response map generation, and model update into a unified energy minimization problem to adaptively select informative feature channels that improve the efficacy of tracking moving objects on the fly. Channel distillation can accurately extract good channels, alleviating the influence of noisy channels and generally reducing the number of channels, as well as adaptively generalizing to different channels and networks. The resulting deep tracker is accurate, fast, and has low memory requirements. Extensive experimental evaluations on popular benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework.

However, the prevalent end-to-end training approach for multi-camera trackers results in detector-specific models, limiting their versatility. Moreover, current generic trackers overlook the unique features of multi-camera detectors, i.e., the unreliability of motion observations and the feasibility of visual information. To address these challenges, we propose RockTrack, a 3D MOT method for multi-camera detectors. Following the Tracking-By-Detection framework, RockTrack is compatible with various off-the-shelf detectors. RockTrack incorporates a confidence-guided preprocessing module to extract reliable motion and image observations from distinct representation spaces from a single detector. These observations are then fused in an association module that leverages geometric and appearance cues to minimize mismatches. The resulting matches are propagated through a staged estimation process, forming the basis for heuristic noise modeling. Additionally, we introduce a novel appearance similarity metric for explicitly characterizing object affinities in multi-camera settings. RockTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes vision-only tracking leaderboard with 59.1% AMOTA while demonstrating impressive computational efficiency.

Recent methods address occlusions using appearance cues through online learning techniques to improve adaptivity or offline learning techniques to utilize temporal information from videos. However, most existing online learning-based MOT methods are unable to learn from all past tracking information to improve adaptivity on long-term occlusions while maintaining real-time tracking speed. On the other hand, temporal information-based offline learning methods maintain a long-term memory to store past tracking information, but this approach restricts them to use only local past information during tracking. To address these challenges, we propose a new MOT framework called the Feature Adaptive Continual-learning Tracker (FACT), which enables real-time tracking and feature learning for targets by utilizing all past tracking information. We demonstrate that the framework can be integrated with various state-of-the-art feature-based trackers, thereby improving their tracking ability. Specifically, we develop the feature adaptive continual-learning (FAC) module, a neural network that can be trained online to learn features adaptively using all past tracking information during tracking. Moreover, we also introduce a two-stage association module specifically designed for the proposed continual learning-based tracking. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art online tracking performance on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Existing trackers can effectively retrieve objects via band regrouping because of the bias in existing HOT datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing visual appearances rather than spectral characteristics. This bias allows the tracker to directly use the visual features obtained from the false-color images generated by hyperspectral images without the need to extract spectral features. To tackle this bias, we find that the tracker should focus on the spectral information when object appearance is unreliable. Thus, we provide a new task called hyperspectral camouflaged object tracking (HCOT) and meticulously construct a large-scale HCOT dataset, termed BihoT, which consists of 41,912 hyperspectral images covering 49 video sequences. The dataset covers various artificial camouflage scenes where objects have similar appearances, diverse spectrums, and frequent occlusion, making it a very challenging dataset for HCOT. Besides, a simple but effective baseline model, named spectral prompt-based distractor-aware network (SPDAN), is proposed, comprising a spectral embedding network (SEN), a spectral prompt-based backbone network (SPBN), and a distractor-aware module (DAM). Specifically, the SEN extracts spectral-spatial features via 3-D and 2-D convolutions. Then, the SPBN fine-tunes powerful RGB trackers with spectral prompts and alleviates the insufficiency of training samples. Moreover, the DAM utilizes a novel statistic to capture the distractor caused by occlusion from objects and background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SPDAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed BihoT and other HOT datasets.

However, the localization method using external measurement devices has limitations in urban environments. Furthermore, if the sensor mount exhibits changes due to environmental influences, they cannot be corrected when the measurement is performed only during the installation. In this paper, we propose self-localization of roadside radar data using Extended Object Tracking (EOT). The method analyses both the tracked trajectories of the vehicles observed by the sensor and the aerial laser scan of city streets, assigns labels of driving behaviors such as "straight ahead", "left turn", "right turn" to trajectory sections and road segments, and performs Semantic Iterative Closest Points (SICP) algorithm to register the point cloud. The method exploits the result from a down stream task -- object tracking -- for localization. We demonstrate high accuracy in the sub-meter range along with very low orientation error. The method also shows good data efficiency. The evaluation is done in both simulation and real-world tests.

However, these methods directly fuse both modalities and thus ignore the environmental attributes, e.g., motion blur, illumination variance, occlusion, scale variation, etc. Meanwhile, insufficient interaction between search and template features makes distinguishing target objects and backgrounds difficult. As a result, performance degradation is induced especially in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel and effective Transformer-based event-guided tracking framework, called eMoE-Tracker, which achieves new SOTA performance under various conditions. Our key idea is to disentangle the environment into several learnable attributes to dynamically learn the attribute-specific features and strengthen the target information by improving the interaction between the target template and search regions. To achieve the goal, we first propose an environmental Mix-of-Experts (eMoE) module that is built upon the environmental Attributes Disentanglement to learn attribute-specific features and environmental Attributes Assembling to assemble the attribute-specific features by the learnable attribute scores dynamically. The eMoE module is a subtle router that prompt-tunes the transformer backbone more efficiently. We then introduce a contrastive relation modeling (CRM) module to emphasize target information by leveraging a contrastive learning strategy between the target template and search regions. Extensive experiments on diverse event-based benchmark datasets showcase the superior performance of our eMoE-Tracker compared to the prior arts.

Traditional multi-object tracking methods often struggle with sports environments due to the similar appearances of players, irregular and unpredictable movements, and significant camera motion. Deep HM-SORT addresses these challenges by integrating deep features, harmonic mean, and Expansion IOU. By leveraging the harmonic mean, our method effectively balances appearance and motion cues, significantly reducing ID-swaps. Additionally, our approach retains all tracklets indefinitely, improving the re-identification of players who leave and re-enter the frame. Experimental results demonstrate that Deep HM-SORT achieves state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale public benchmarks, SportsMOT and SoccerNet Tracking Challenge 2023. Specifically, our method achieves 80.1 HOTA on the SportsMOT dataset and 85.4 HOTA on the SoccerNet-Tracking dataset, outperforming existing trackers in key metrics such as HOTA, IDF1, AssA, and MOTA. This robust solution provides enhanced accuracy and reliability for automated sports analytics, offering significant improvements over previous methods without introducing additional computational cost.

Despite significant progress, existing regression-based trackers still tend to experience failures and inaccuracies. To enhance the precision of target estimation, this paper proposes a tracking technique based on robust regression. Firstly, we introduce a novel robust linear regression estimator, which achieves favorable performance when the error vector follows i.i.d Gaussian-Laplacian distribution. Secondly, we design an iterative process to quickly solve the problem of outliers. In fact, the coefficients are obtained by Iterative Gradient Descent and Threshold Selection algorithm (IGDTS). In addition, we expend IGDTS to a generative tracker, and apply IGDTS-distance to measure the deviation between the sample and the model. Finally, we propose an update scheme to capture the appearance changes of the tracked object and ensure that the model is updated correctly. Experimental results on several challenging image sequences show that the proposed tracker outperformance existing trackers.

Tracking-by-attention, however, entangles detection and tracking queries in one embedding for both the detection and tracking task, which is sub-optimal. Other approaches resemble the tracking-by-detection paradigm and detect objects using decoupled track and detection queries followed by a subsequent association. These methods, however, do not leverage synergies between the detection and association task. Combining the strengths of both paradigms, we introduce ADA-Track++, a novel end-to-end framework for 3D MOT from multi-view cameras. We introduce a learnable data association module based on edge-augmented cross-attention, leveraging appearance and geometric features. We also propose an auxiliary token in this attention-based association module, which helps mitigate disproportionately high attention to incorrect association targets caused by attention normalization. Furthermore, we integrate this association module into the decoder layer of a DETR-based 3D detector, enabling simultaneous DETR-like query-to-image cross-attention for detection and query-to-query cross-attention for data association. By stacking these decoder layers, queries are refined for the detection and association task alternately, effectively harnessing the task dependencies. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the advantage of our approach compared to the two previous paradigms.

However, existing methods primarily focus on band regrouping and rely on RGB trackers for feature extraction, resulting in limited exploration of spectral information and difficulties in achieving complementary representations of object features. In this paper, a spatial-spectral fusion network with spectral angle awareness (SST-Net) is proposed for hyperspectral (HS) object tracking. Firstly, to address the issue of insufficient spectral feature extraction in existing networks, a spatial-spectral feature backbone ($S^2$FB) is designed. With the spatial and spectral extraction branch, a joint representation of texture and spectrum is obtained. Secondly, a spectral attention fusion module (SAFM) is presented to capture the intra- and inter-modality correlation to obtain the fused features from the HS and RGB modalities. It can incorporate the visual information into the HS spectral context to form a robust representation. Thirdly, to ensure a more accurate response of the tracker to the object position, a spectral angle awareness module (SAAM) investigates the region-level spectral similarity between the template and search images during the prediction stage. Furthermore, we develop a novel spectral angle awareness loss (SAAL) to offer guidance for the SAAM based on similar regions. Finally, to obtain the robust tracking results, a weighted prediction method is considered to combine the HS and RGB predicted motions of objects to leverage the strengths of each modality. Extensive experiments on the HOTC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SSF-Net, compared with state-of-the-art trackers.

Tacking-by-detection (TBD) trackers with Kalman Filter motion prediction work well in pedestrian-dominant scenarios but fall short in complex situations when multiple objects perform non-linear and diverse motion simultaneously. To tackle the complex non-linear motion, we propose a real-time diffusion-based MOT approach named DiffMOT. Specifically, for the motion predictor component, we propose a novel Decoupled Diffusion-based Motion Predictor (D$^2$MP). It models the entire distribution of various motion presented by the data as a whole. It also predicts an individual object's motion conditioning on an individual's historical motion information. Furthermore, it optimizes the diffusion process with much fewer sampling steps. As a MOT tracker, the DiffMOT is real-time at 22.7FPS, and also outperforms the state-of-the-art on DanceTrack and SportsMOT datasets with $62.3\%$ and $76.2\%$ in HOTA metrics, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, DiffMOT is the first to introduce a diffusion probabilistic model into the MOT to tackle non-linear motion prediction.

These assumptions render the Kalman Filter-based trackers effective in linear motion scenarios. However, these linear assumptions serve as a key limitation when estimating future object locations within scenarios involving non-linear motion and occlusions. To address this issue, we propose a motion-based MOT approach with an adaptable motion predictor, called AM-SORT, which adapts to estimate non-linear uncertainties. AM-SORT is a novel extension of the SORT-series trackers that supersedes the Kalman Filter with the transformer architecture as a motion predictor. We introduce a historical trajectory embedding that empowers the transformer to extract spatio-temporal features from a sequence of bounding boxes. AM-SORT achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers on DanceTrack, with 56.3 IDF1 and 55.6 HOTA.

In the prevalent Siamese-based paradigm, the features extracted by the Siamese-like networks are often insufficient to model the tracked targets and distractor objects, thereby hindering them from being robust and discriminative simultaneously. While most Siamese trackers focus on designing robust correlation operations, we propose a novel single-branch tracking framework inspired by the transformer. Unlike the Siamese-like feature extraction, our tracker deeply embeds cross-image feature correlation in multiple layers of the feature network. By extensively matching the features of the two images through multiple layers, it can suppress non-target features, resulting in target-aware feature extraction. The output features can be directly used for predicting target locations without additional correlation steps. Thus, we reformulate the two-branch Siamese tracking as a conceptually simple, fully transformer-based Single-Branch Tracking pipeline, dubbed SBT. After conducting an in-depth analysis of the SBT baseline, we summarize many effective design principles and propose an improved tracker dubbed SuperSBT. SuperSBT adopts a hierarchical architecture with a local modeling layer to enhance shallow-level features. A unified relation modeling is proposed to remove complex handcrafted layer pattern designs. SuperSBT is further improved by masked image modeling pre-training, integrating temporal modeling, and equipping with dedicated prediction heads. Thus, SuperSBT outperforms the SBT baseline by 4.7%,3.0%, and 4.5% AUC scores in LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10K. Notably, SuperSBT greatly raises the speed of SBT from 37 FPS to 81 FPS. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results on eight VOT benchmarks.

This is largely due to two distinct reasons. Transparent objects are unique in that their appearance is directly affected by the background. Furthermore, transparent object scenes often contain many visually similar objects (distractors), which often lead to tracking failure. However, development of modern tracking architectures requires large training sets, which do not exist in transparent object tracking. We present two contributions addressing the aforementioned issues. We propose the first transparent object tracking training dataset Trans2k that consists of over 2k sequences with 104,343 images overall, annotated by bounding boxes and segmentation masks. Standard trackers trained on this dataset consistently improve by up to 16%. Our second contribution is a new distractor-aware transparent object tracker (DiTra) that treats localization accuracy and target identification as separate tasks and implements them by a novel architecture.

One approach for tactile servo control with high-resolution soft tactile sensors is to estimate the contact pose relative to an object surface using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for use as a feedback signal. In this paper, we investigate how the surface pose estimation model can be extended to include shear, and utilize these combined pose-and-shear models to develop a tactile robotic system that can be programmed for diverse non-prehensile manipulation tasks, such as object tracking, surface following, single-arm object pushing and dual-arm object pushing. In doing this, two technical challenges had to be overcome. Firstly, the use of tactile data that includes shear-induced slippage can lead to error-prone estimates unsuitable for accurate control, and so we modified the CNN into a Gaussian-density neural network and used a discriminative Bayesian filter to improve the predictions with a state dynamics model that utilizes the robot kinematics. Secondly, to achieve smooth robot motion in 3D space while interacting with objects, we used SE(3) velocity-based servo control, which required re-deriving the Bayesian filter update equations using Lie group theory, as many standard assumptions do not hold for state variables defined on non-Euclidean manifolds. In future, we believe that pose and shear-based tactile servoing will enable many object manipulation tasks and the fully-dexterous utilization of multi-fingered tactile robot hands.

Previous works typically add expensive modules to DETR to perform Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), resulting in more complicated architectures. We instead show how DETR can be turned into a MOT model by employing an instance-level contrastive loss, a revised sampling strategy and a lightweight assignment method. Our training scheme learns object appearances while preserving detection capabilities and with little overhead. Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by +2.6 mMOTA on the challenging BDD100K dataset and is comparable to existing transformer-based methods on the MOT17 dataset.

For a robotic hand to control soft objects, it has to acquire online state feedback of the deforming object. While RGB-D cameras can collect occluded point clouds at a rate of 30Hz, this does not represent a continuously trackable object surface. Hence, in this work, we developed a method that takes as input a template mesh which is the mesh of an object in its non-deformed state and a deformed point cloud of the same object, and then shapes the template mesh such that it matches the deformed point cloud. The reconstruction of meshes from point clouds has long been studied in the field of Computer graphics under 3D reconstruction and 4D reconstruction, however, both lack the speed and generalizability needed for robotics applications. Our model is designed using a point cloud auto-encoder and a Real-NVP architecture. Our trained model can perform mesh reconstruction and tracking at a rate of 58Hz on a template mesh of 3000 vertices and a deformed point cloud of 5000 points and is generalizable to the deformations of six different object categories which are assumed to be made of soft material in our experiments (scissors, hammer, foam brick, cleanser bottle, orange, and dice). The object meshes are taken from the YCB benchmark dataset. An instance of a downstream application can be the control algorithm for a robotic hand that requires online feedback from the state of the manipulated object which would allow online grasp adaptation in a closed-loop manner. Furthermore, the tracking capacity of our method can help in the system identification of deforming objects in a marker-free approach. In future work, we will extend our trained model to generalize beyond six object categories and additionally to real-world deforming point clouds.

However, in realistic scenarios, such as shop floor operations, such an assumption may not hold and personalized target recognition by the robot in crowded environments is required. To fulfil this requirement, in this work, we propose a person re-identification module based on continual visual adaptation techniques that ensure the robot's seamless cooperation with the appropriate individual even subject to varying visual appearances or partial or complete occlusions. We test the framework singularly using recorded videos in a laboratory environment and an HRI scenario, i.e., a person-following task by a mobile robot. The targets are asked to change their appearance during tracking and to disappear from the camera field of view to test the challenging cases of occlusion and outfit variations. We compare our framework with one of the state-of-the-art Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) methods and the results show that the CARPE-ID can accurately track each selected target throughout the experiments in all the cases (except two limit cases). At the same time, the s-o-t-a MOT has a mean of 4 tracking errors for each video.

To address such problems, a divide-and-conquer manner has been employed with parallel computation. In this strategy, distinguished objects that have unique labels are grouped based on their statistical dependencies, the intersection of predicted measurements. Several geometry approaches have been used for label grouping since finding all intersected label pairs is clearly infeasible for large-scale tracking problems. This paper proposes an efficient implementation of label grouping for label-partitioned generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli filter framework using a secondary partitioning technique. This allows for parallel computation in the label graph indexing step, avoiding generating and eliminating duplicate comparisons. Additionally, we compare the performance of the proposed technique with several efficient spatial searching algorithms. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach on large-scale data sets, enabling scalable trajectory estimation.

Due to its ability to asynchronously capture light intensity changes, event camera has an inherent advantage to capture moving objects in challenging scenarios including objects under low light, high dynamic range, or fast moving objects. Thus event camera are natural for visual object tracking. However, the current event-based trackers derived from RGB trackers simply modify the input images to event frames and still follow conventional tracking pipeline that mainly focus on object texture for target distinction. As a result, the trackers may not be robust dealing with challenging scenarios such as moving cameras and cluttered foreground. In this paper, we propose a distractor-aware event-based tracker that introduces transformer modules into Siamese network architecture (named DANet). Specifically, our model is mainly composed of a motion-aware network and a target-aware network, which simultaneously exploits both motion cues and object contours from event data, so as to discover motion objects and identify the target object by removing dynamic distractors. Our DANet can be trained in an end-to-end manner without any post-processing and can run at over 80 FPS on a single V100. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two large event tracking datasets to validate the proposed model. We demonstrate that our tracker has superior performance against the state-of-the-art trackers in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

This approach can gather measurements from multiple humans, expanding its range of applications. The key idea is to use two types of trackers, SLAM and MOT, to monitor stationary objects and moving humans and assess their interactions. This method achieves stable predictions of traversability even in challenging visual scenarios, such as occlusions, nonlinear perspectives, depth uncertainty, and intersections involving multiple humans. Additionally, we extend map quality metrics to apply to traversability maps, facilitating future research. We validate our proposed method through fusion and comparison with established techniques.

However, due to the potential deformation and rotation experienced by the tracked targets, the genuine bounding box fails to capture the appearance information explicitly and introduces cluttered background. This paper proposes RTrack, a novel object representation baseline tracker that utilizes a set of sample points to get a pseudo bounding box. RTrack automatically arranges these points to define the spatial extents and highlight local areas. Building upon the baseline, we conducted an in-depth exploration of the training potential and introduced a one-to-many leading assignment strategy. It is worth noting that our approach achieves competitive performance to the state-of-the-art trackers on the GOT-10k dataset while reducing training time to just 10% of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers' training costs. The substantial reduction in training costs brings single-object tracking (SOT) closer to the object detection (OD) task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RTrack achieves SOTA results with faster convergence.

This study introduces a more efficient training strategy to mitigate overfitting and reduce computational requirements. We balance the training process with a mix of negative and positive samples from the outset, named as Joint learning with Negative samples (JN). Negative samples refer to scenarios where the object from the template is not present in the search region, which helps to prevent the model from simply memorizing the target, and instead encourages it to use the template for object location. To handle the negative samples effectively, we adopt a distribution-based head, which modeling the bounding box as distribution of distances to express uncertainty about the target's location in the presence of negative samples, offering an efficient way to manage the mixed sample training. Furthermore, our approach introduces a target-indicating token. It encapsulates the target's precise location within the template image. This method provides exact boundary details with negligible computational cost but improving performance. Our model, JN-256, exhibits superior performance on challenging benchmarks, achieving 75.8% AO on GOT-10k and 84.1% AUC on TrackingNet. Notably, JN-256 outperforms previous SOTA trackers that utilize larger models and higher input resolutions, even though it is trained with only half the number of data sampled used in those works.

Nevertheless, prior works have been resource-intensive, requiring prolonged GPU training hours and incurring high GFLOPs during inference due to inefficient training methods and convolution-based target heads. This intensive resource use renders them unsuitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we present DETRack, a streamlined end-to-end visual object tracking framework. Our framework utilizes an efficient encoder-decoder structure where the deformable transformer decoder acting as a target head, achieves higher sparsity than traditional convolution heads, resulting in decreased GFLOPs. For training, we introduce a novel one-to-many label assignment and an auxiliary denoising technique, significantly accelerating model's convergence. Comprehensive experiments affirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. For instance, DETRack achieves 72.9% AO on challenging GOT-10k benchmarks using only 20% of the training epochs required by the baseline, and runs with lower GFLOPs than all the transformer-based trackers.

This setting restricts the tracker's functionality in the real world, especially for fast motion. Event-based cameras as bioinspired sensors provide considerable potential for high frame rate tracking due to their high temporal resolution. However, event-based cameras cannot offer fine-grained texture information like conventional cameras. This unique complementarity motivates us to combine conventional frames and events for high frame rate object tracking under various challenging conditions. Inthispaper, we propose an end-to-end network consisting of multi-modality alignment and fusion modules to effectively combine meaningful information from both modalities at different measurement rates. The alignment module is responsible for cross-style and cross-frame-rate alignment between frame and event modalities under the guidance of the moving cues furnished by events. While the fusion module is accountable for emphasizing valuable features and suppressing noise information by the mutual complement between the two modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art trackers by a significant margin in high frame rate tracking. With the FE240hz dataset, our approach achieves high frame rate tracking up to 240Hz.

In this paper, we present a feasibility study and systematic analysis of a camera-based indoor localization and multi-person tracking system implemented on edge computing devices within a large indoor space. To this end, we deployed an end-to-end edge computing pipeline that utilizes multiple cameras to achieve localization, body orientation estimation and tracking of multiple individuals within a large therapeutic space spanning $1700m^2$, all while maintaining a strong focus on preserving privacy. Our pipeline consists of 39 edge computing camera systems equipped with Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) placed in the indoor space's ceiling. To ensure the privacy of individuals, a real-time multi-person pose estimation algorithm runs on the TPU of the computing camera system. This algorithm extracts poses and bounding boxes, which are utilized for indoor localization, body orientation estimation, and multi-person tracking. Our pipeline demonstrated an average localization error of 1.41 meters, a multiple-object tracking accuracy score of 88.6\%, and a mean absolute body orientation error of 29\degree. These results shows that localization and tracking of individuals in a large indoor space is feasible even with the privacy constrains.

Multiple object tracking refers to the process of estimating in real time these trajectories, leveraging for this purpose sensors to detect the objects. This paper deals with devising attacks on object tracking in automated vehicles. The vehicle is assumed to have a detection-based object tracking system that relies on multiple sensors and uses an estimator such as a Kalman filter for sensor fusion and state estimation. The attack goal is to modify the object's state estimated by the victim vehicle to put the vehicle in an unsafe situation. This goal is achieved by judiciously perturbing some or all of the sensor outputs corresponding to the object of interest over a desired horizon. A stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) problem is formulated to compute the sequence of perturbations, whereby hard constraints on the perturbations and probabilistic chance constraints on the object's state are imposed. The chance constraints ensure that some desired conditions for a successful attack are satisfied with a prespecified probability. Reasonable assumptions are then made to obtain a computationally tractable linear SMPC program. The approach is demonstrated on an adaptive cruise control system in a simulation environment, where successful sequential attacks are generated, leading the victim vehicle into dangerous driving situations including collisions.

Despite competitive performance, in crowded scenes, joint detection and tracking usually fail to find accurate object associations due to missed or false detections. In this paper, we jointly model counting, detection and re-identification in an end-to-end framework, named CountingMOT, tailored for crowded scenes. By imposing mutual object-count constraints between detection and counting, the CountingMOT tries to find a balance between object detection and crowd density map estimation, which can help it to recover missed detections or reject false detections. Our approach is an attempt to bridge the gap of object detection, counting, and re-Identification. This is in contrast to prior MOT methods that either ignore the crowd density and thus are prone to failure in crowded scenes,or depend on local correlations to build a graphical relationship for matching targets. The proposed MOT tracker can perform online and real-time tracking, and achieves the state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks MOT16 (MOTA of 79.7), MOT17 (MOTA of 81.3%) and MOT20 (MOTA of 78.9%).

Another issue is the sparse point returns will damage the feature matching procedure of the SOT task. Based on these insights, we introduce two novel modules, i.e., Adaptive Refine Prediction (ARP) and Target Knowledge Transfer (TKT), to tackle them, respectively. To this end, we first design a strong pipeline to extract discriminative features and conduct the matching with the attention mechanism. Then, ARP module is proposed to tackle the misalignment issue by aggregating all predicted candidates with valuable clues. Finally, TKT module is designed to effectively overcome incomplete point cloud due to sparse and occlusion issues. We call our overall framework PCET.

</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2208.08829">Learning Spatial-Frequency Transformer for Visual Object Tracking</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>Recent trackers adopt the Transformer to combine or replace the widely used ResNet as their new backbone network. Although their trackers work well in regular scenarios, however, they simply flatten the 2D features into a sequence to better match the Transformer. We believe these operations ignore the spatial prior of the target object which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In addition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass filter, which is independent of input features or key/queries. That is to say, it may suppress the high-frequency component of the input features and preserve or even amplify the low-frequency information. To handle these issues, in this paper, we propose a unified Spatial-Frequency Transformer that models the Gaussian spatial Prior and High-frequency emphasis Attention (GPHA) simultaneously. To be specific, Gaussian spatial prior is generated using dual Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and injected into the similarity matrix produced by multiplying Query and Key features in self-attention. The output will be fed into a Softmax layer and then decomposed into two components, i.e., the direct signal and high-frequency signal. The low- and high-pass branches are rescaled and combined to achieve all-pass, therefore, the high-frequency features will be protected well in stacked self-attention layers. We further integrate the Spatial-Frequency Transformer into the Siamese tracking framework and propose a novel tracking algorithm, termed SFTransT. The cross-scale fusion based SwinTransformer is adopted as the backbone, and also a multi-head cross-attention module is used to boost the interaction between search and template features. The output will be fed into the tracking head for target localization. Extensive experiments on both short-term and long-term tracking benchmarks all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

The proposed tracker, MeNToS, addresses particularly the long-term data association problem, when objects are not observable for long time intervals. Indeed, the recently introduced HOTA metric (High Order Tracking Accuracy), which has a better alignment than the formerly established MOTA (Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy) with the human visual assessment of tracking, has shown that improvements are still needed for data association, despite the recent improvement in object detection. In MeNToS, after creating tracklets using instance segmentation and optical flow, the proposed method relies on a space-time memory network originally developed for one-shot video object segmentation to improve the association of sequence of detections (tracklets) with temporal gaps. We evaluate our tracker on KITTIMOTS and MOTSChallenge and we show the benefit of our data association strategy with the HOTA metric. Additional ablation studies demonstrate that our approach using a space-time memory network gives better and more robust long-term association than those based on a re-identification network.

While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.

This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.

Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is available at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ahYgzmEWP.

However, maintaining consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion. However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9% on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

In this study, a novel benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers. The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage.

Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas \textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving \textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

It becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range, that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation. Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance, significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

Instead of relying on task-specific robot demonstrations collected via teleoperation, HAND uses easy-to-provide hand demonstrations to retrieve relevant behaviors from task-agnostic robot play data. Using a visual tracking pipeline, HAND extracts the motion of the human hand from the hand demonstration and retrieves robot sub-trajectories in two stages: first filtering by visual similarity, then retrieving trajectories with similar behaviors to the hand. Fine-tuning a policy on the retrieved data enables real-time learning of tasks in under four minutes, without requiring calibrated cameras or detailed hand pose estimation. Experiments also show that HAND outperforms retrieval baselines by over 2x in average task success rates on real robots.

Speeding up 3D ground truth generation for such challenging scenes is performance-critical yet very challenging. The difficulties include the sparsity of the captured pedestrian point cloud and a lack of suitable benchmarks for a specific system design study. To tackle the challenges, we first collect a new multi-view LiDAR-camera 3D multiple-object-tracking benchmark of highly crowded pedestrians for in-depth analysis. We then build an offboard auto-labeling system that reconstructs pedestrian trajectories from LiDAR point cloud and multi-view images. To improve the generalization power for crowded scenes and the performance for small objects, we propose to learn high-resolution representations that are density-aware and relationship-aware. Extensive experiments validate that our approach significantly improves the 3D pedestrian tracking performance towards higher auto-labeling efficiency.

In this paper, we present the Asynchronous Event Multi-Object Tracking (AEMOT) algorithm for detecting and tracking multiple objects by processing individual raw events asynchronously. AEMOT detects salient event blob features by identifying regions of consistent optical flow using a novel Field of Active Flow Directions built from the Surface of Active Events. Detected features are tracked as candidate objects using the recently proposed Asynchronous Event Blob (AEB) tracker in order to construct small intensity patches of each candidate object. A novel learnt validation stage promotes or discards candidate objects based on classification of their intensity patches, with promoted objects having their position, velocity, size, and orientation estimated at their event rate.

While unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are commonly used for indoor farm monitoring, their deployment in greenhouses is often constrained by infrastructure limitations, sensor placement challenges, and operational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we develop a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB-D camera, a 3D LiDAR, and an IMU sensor. The UAV employs a LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm for precise navigation in GNSS-denied environments and utilizes a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm to estimate the count and weight of cherry tomatoes. We evaluate the system using two dataset: one from a harvesting row and another from a growing row. In the harvesting-row dataset, the proposed system achieves 94.4\% counting accuracy and 87.5\% weight estimation accuracy within a 13.2-meter flight completed in 10.5 seconds. For the growing-row dataset, which consists of occluded unripened fruits, we qualitatively analyze tracking performance and highlight future research directions for improving perception in greenhouse with strong occlusions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of UAVs for efficient robotic yield estimation in commercial greenhouses.

This system advances the role of synthetic data in addressing machine learning training limitations, enabling more robust and generalizable models for real-world applications.

This study introduces Deep LG-Track, a novel multi-object tracker that incorporates three key enhancements to improve the tracking accuracy and robustness. First, an adaptive Kalman filter is developed to dynamically update the covariance of measurement noise based on detection confidence and trajectory disappearance. Second, a novel cost matrix is formulated to adaptively fuse motion and appearance information, leveraging localization confidence and detection confidence as weighting factors. Third, a dynamic appearance feature updating strategy is introduced, adjusting the relative weighting of historical and current appearance features based on appearance clarity and localization accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate that the proposed Deep LG-Track consistently outperforms state-of-the-art trackers across multiple performance metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in multi-object tracking tasks.

However, the majority of AR games still rely on pre-scanned or static scenes, and interaction mechanisms are often limited to controllers or hand-tracking. Additionally, the presence of identical objects in AR games poses challenges for conventional object tracking techniques, which often struggle to differentiate between identical objects or necessitate the installation of fixed cameras for global object movement tracking. In response to these limitations, we present a novel approach to address the tracking of identical objects in an AR scene to enrich physical-virtual interaction. Our method leverages partial scene observations captured by an AR headset, utilizing the perspective and spatial data provided by this technology. Object identities within the scene are determined through the solution of a label assignment problem using integer programming. To enhance computational efficiency, we incorporate a Voronoi diagram-based pruning method into our approach. Our implementation of this approach in a farm-to-table AR game demonstrates its satisfactory performance and robustness. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility and practicality of our method through applications in AR storytelling and a simulated gaming robot.

Unlike traditional multi-object tracking, RMOT identifies and tracks objects and incorporates textual descriptions for object class names, making the approach more intuitive. Various techniques have been proposed to address this challenging problem; however, most require the training of the entire network due to their end-to-end nature. Among these methods, iKUN has emerged as a particularly promising solution. Therefore, we further explore its pipeline and enhance its performance. In this paper, we introduce a practical module dubbed Memory-Efficient Cross-modality -- MEX. This memory-efficient technique can be directly applied to off-the-shelf trackers like iKUN, resulting in significant architectural improvements. Our method proves effective during inference on a single GPU with 4 GB of memory. Among the various benchmarks, the Refer-KITTI dataset, which offers diverse autonomous driving scenes with relevant language expressions, is particularly useful for studying this problem. Empirically, our method demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency regarding HOTA tracking scores, substantially improving memory allocation and processing speed.

In this work, we aim to reveal the broader capabilities, advantages, and potential challenges of this architecture across various specifically designed scenarios, including a pedestrian tracking dataset.

Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.

Fully-supervised learning methods are known to achieve excellent tracking performances, but acquiring identity-level annotations is tedious and time-consuming. Motivated by the fact that in real-world scenarios object motion can be usually represented by a Markov process, we present a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that trains a neural network to associate detections for tracking, without requiring prior knowledge of their temporal correspondences. At the core of our method lies a neural Kalman filter, with an observation model conditioned on associations of detections parameterized by a neural network. Given a batch of frames as input, data associations between detections from adjacent frames are predicted by a neural network followed by a Sinkhorn normalization that determines the assignment probabilities of detections to states. Kalman smoothing is then used to obtain the marginal probability of observations given the inferred states, producing a training objective to maximize this marginal probability using gradient descent. The proposed framework is fully differentiable, allowing the underlying neural model to be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our approach on the challenging MOT17, MOT20, and BDD100K datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to self-supervised trackers using public detections.

By combining data from diverse sensors like cameras and LIDARs, fusion techniques can overcome the limitations of individual sensors, enabling a more complete and accurate perception of the environment. We introduce a novel approach to multi-modal sensor fusion, focusing on developing a graph-based state representation that supports critical decision-making processes in autonomous driving. We present a Sensor-Agnostic Graph-Aware Kalman Filter [3], the first online state estimation technique designed to fuse multi-modal graphs derived from noisy multi-sensor data. The estimated graph-based state representations serve as a foundation for advanced applications like Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), offering a comprehensive framework for enhancing the situational awareness and safety of autonomous systems. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world driving datasets (nuScenes). Our results showcase an improvement in MOTA and a reduction in estimated position errors (MOTP) and identity switches (IDS) for tracked objects using the SAGA-KF. Furthermore, we highlight the capability of such a framework to develop methods that can leverage heterogeneous information (like semantic objects and geometric structures) from various sensing modalities, enabling a more holistic approach to scene understanding and enhancing the safety and effectiveness of autonomous systems.

Unlike state of the art models, linear splines allow to represent extended objects whose contour is an arbitrarily complex curve. An exact likelihood is derived for the case in which noisy measurements can be scattered from any point on the contour of the extended object, while an approximate Monte Carlo likelihood is provided for the case wherein scattering points can be anywhere, i.e. inside or on the contour, on the object surface. Exploiting such likelihood to measure how well the observed data fit a given shape, a suitable estimator is developed. The proposed estimator models the extended object in terms of a kinematic state, providing object position and orientation, along with a shape vector, characterizing object contour and surface. The kinematic state is estimated via a nonlinear Kalman filter, while the shape vector is estimated via a Bayesian classifier so that classification is implicitly solved during shape estimation. Numerical experiments are provided to assess, compared to state of the art extended object estimators, the effectiveness of the proposed one.

The majority of existing SLAM solutions heavily rely on a primarily static assumption. However, due to the presence of moving vehicles and pedestrians, this assumption does not always hold, leading to localization accuracy decreased and maps distorted. To address this challenge, we propose TRLO, a dynamic LiDAR odometry that efficiently improves the accuracy of state estimation and generates a cleaner point cloud map. To efficiently detect dynamic objects in the surrounding environment, a deep learning-based method is applied, generating detection bounding boxes. We then design a 3D multi-object tracker based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and nearest neighbor (NN) strategy to reliably identify and remove dynamic objects. Subsequently, a fast two-stage iterative nearest point solver is employed to solve the state estimation using cleaned static point cloud. Note that a novel hash-based keyframe database management is proposed for fast access to search keyframes. Furthermore, all the detected object bounding boxes are leveraged to impose posture consistency constraint to further refine the final state estimation. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies conducted on the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves more accurate state estimation but also generates cleaner maps, compared with baselines.

Generic Multiple Object Tracking (GMOT) emerges as a promising solution, requiring less prior information. Nevertheless, existing GMOT methods, primarily designed as OneShot-GMOT, rely heavily on initial bounding boxes and often struggle with variations in viewpoint, lighting, occlusion, and scale. To overcome the limitations inherent in both MOT and GMOT when it comes to tracking objects with specific generic attributes, we introduce Grounded-GMOT, an innovative tracking paradigm that enables users to track multiple generic objects in videos through natural language descriptors.
  Our contributions begin with the introduction of the G2MOT dataset, which includes a collection of videos featuring a wide variety of generic objects, each accompanied by detailed textual descriptions of their attributes. Following this, we propose a novel tracking method, KAM-SORT, which not only effectively integrates visual appearance with motion cues but also enhances the Kalman filter. KAM-SORT proves particularly advantageous when dealing with objects of high visual similarity from the same generic category in GMOT scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grounded-GMOT outperforms existing OneShot-GMOT approaches. Additionally, our extensive comparisons between various trackers highlight KAM-SORT's efficacy in GMOT, further establishing its significance in the field.

Although exhibiting uncertainty through a confidence score, these predictions do not capture the entire variability of the inference process. For safety and security critical applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, etc., knowing this predictive uncertainty is essential though. Therefore, we introduce, for the first time, a fast way to obtain the empirical predictive distribution during object detection and incorporate that knowledge in multi-object tracking. Our mechanism can easily be integrated into state-of-the-art trackers, enabling them to fully exploit the uncertainty in the detections.

We first establish a centralised VI sensor fusion scheme as a benchmark and analyse the limitations of its decentralised counterpart, which requires sensors to await consensus at each VI iteration. Therefore, we propose a decentralised gradient-based VI framework that optimises the Locally Maximised Evidence Lower Bound (LM-ELBO) instead of the standard ELBO, which reduces the parameter search space and enables faster convergence, making it particularly beneficial for decentralised tracking. This proposed framework is inherently self-evolving, improving with advancements in decentralised optimisation techniques for convergence guarantees and efficiency. Further, we enhance the convergence speed of proposed decentralised schemes using natural gradients and gradient tracking strategies. Results verify that our decentralised VI schemes are empirically equivalent to centralised fusion in tracking performance. Notably, the decentralised natural gradient VI method is the most communication-efficient, with communication costs comparable to suboptimal decentralised strategies while delivering notably higher tracking accuracy.

These methods typically rely on the Kalman Filter to estimate the future locations of objects, assuming linear object motion. However, they fall short when tracking objects exhibiting nonlinear and diverse motion in scenarios like dancing and sports. In addition, there has been limited focus on utilizing learning-based motion predictors in MOT. To address these challenges, we resort to exploring data-driven motion prediction methods. Inspired by the great expectation of state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, in long-term sequence modeling with near-linear complexity, we introduce a Mamba-based motion model named Mamba moTion Predictor (MTP). MTP is designed to model the complex motion patterns of objects like dancers and athletes. Specifically, MTP takes the spatial-temporal location dynamics of objects as input, captures the motion pattern using a bi-Mamba encoding layer, and predicts the next motion. In real-world scenarios, objects may be missed due to occlusion or motion blur, leading to premature termination of their trajectories. To tackle this challenge, we further expand the application of MTP. We employ it in an autoregressive way to compensate for missing observations by utilizing its own predictions as inputs, thereby contributing to more consistent trajectories. Our proposed tracker, MambaTrack, demonstrates advanced performance on benchmarks such as Dancetrack and SportsMOT, which are characterized by complex motion and severe occlusion.

Some common limitations in MOT are varying object appearances, occlusions, or crowded scenes. To address these challenges, machine learning methods have been extensively deployed, leveraging large datasets, sophisticated models, and substantial computational resources. Due to practical limitations, access to the above is not always an option. However, with the recent release of foundation models by prominent AI companies, pretrained models have been trained on vast datasets and resources using state-of-the-art methods. This work tries to leverage one such foundation model, called DINOv2, through using knowledge distillation. The proposed method uses a teacher-student architecture, where DINOv2 is the teacher and the FairMOT backbone HRNetv2 W18 is the student. The results imply that although the proposed method shows improvements in certain scenarios, it does not consistently outperform the original FairMOT model.

However, maintaining directional mmWave links in dynamic mobile environments is challenging due to mobility-induced disruptions and blockage. While effective, the current 5G NR beam training methods incur significant overhead and scalability issues in multi-user scenarios. To address this, we introduce CommRad, a sensing-driven solution incorporating a radar sensor at the base station to track mobile users and maintain directional beams even under blockages. While radar provides high-resolution object tracking, it suffers from a fundamental challenge of lack of context, i.e., it cannot discern which objects in the environment represent active users, reflectors, or blockers. To obtain this contextual awareness, CommRad unites wireless sensing capabilities of bi-static radio communication with the mono-static radar sensor, allowing radios to provide initial context to radar sensors. Subsequently, the radar aids in user tracking and sustains mobile links even in obstructed scenarios, resulting in robust and high-throughput directional connections for all mobile users at all times. We evaluate this collaborative radar-radio framework using a 28 GHz mmWave testbed integrated with a radar sensor in various indoor and outdoor scenarios, demonstrating a 2.5x improvement in median throughput compared to a non-collaborative baseline.

To that end, we introduce GeoWATCH, a flexible framework for training models on long sequences of satellite images sourced from multiple sensor platforms, which is designed to handle image classification, activity recognition, object detection, or object tracking tasks. Our system includes a novel partial weight loading mechanism based on sub-graph isomorphism which allows for continually training and modifying a network over many training cycles. This has allowed us to train a lineage of models over a long period of time, which we have observed has improved performance as we adjust configurations while maintaining a core backbone.

Existing state-of-the-art trackers in computer vision integrate sophisticated architectures, attention mechanisms, and multi-modal fusion to enhance tracking accuracy across diverse environments. However, the challenges posed by satellite imagery, such as background variations, atmospheric disturbances, and low-resolution object delineation, significantly impede the precision and reliability of traditional Single Object Tracking (SOT) techniques. Our study delves into these challenges and proposes prompt engineering methodologies, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and TAPIR (Tracking Any Point with per-frame Initialization and temporal Refinement), to create a training-free point-based tracking method for small-scale objects on satellite videos. Experiments on the VISO dataset validate our strategy, marking a significant advancement in robust tracking solutions tailored for satellite imagery in remote sensing applications.

However, underwater optical factors like light refraction and absorption present challenges to underwater vision, which cause degradation of underwater images. A variety of underwater image enhancement methods have been proposed to improve the effectiveness of underwater vision perception. Nevertheless, for real-time vision tasks on underwater robots, it is necessary to overcome the challenges associated with algorithmic efficiency and real-time capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Lightweight Underwater Unet (LU2Net), a novel U-shape network designed specifically for real-time enhancement of underwater images. The proposed model incorporates axial depthwise convolution and the channel attention module, enabling it to significantly reduce computational demands and model parameters, thereby improving processing speed. The extensive experiments conducted on the dataset and real-world underwater robots demonstrate the exceptional performance and speed of proposed model. It is capable of providing well-enhanced underwater images at a speed 8 times faster than the current state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement method. Moreover, LU2Net is able to handle real-time underwater video enhancement.

However, many methods that rely on filtering-based algorithms, such as the Kalman Filter, often work well in linear motion scenarios but struggle to accurately predict the locations of objects undergoing complex and non-linear movements. To tackle these scenarios, we propose a motion-based MOT approach with an enhanced temporal motion predictor, ETTrack. Specifically, the motion predictor integrates a transformer model and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to capture short-term and long-term motion patterns, and it predicts the future motion of individual objects based on the historical motion information. Additionally, we propose a novel Momentum Correction Loss function that provides additional information regarding the motion direction of objects during training. This allows the motion predictor rapidly adapt to motion variations and more accurately predict future motion. Our experimental results demonstrate that ETTrack achieves a competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art trackers on DanceTrack and SportsMOT, scoring 56.4% and 74.4% in HOTA metrics, respectively.

Tracking players from monocular broadcast feeds is an important computer vision problem offering various downstream analytics and enhanced viewership experience. However, existing trackers encounter significant difficulties in dealing with occlusions, blurs, and agile player movements prevalent in telecast feeds. In this work, we propose a novel tracking approach by formulating MOT as a bipartite graph matching problem infused with homography. We disentangle the positional representations of occluded and overlapping players in broadcast view, by mapping their foot keypoints to an overhead rink template, and encode these projected positions into the graph network. This ensures reliable spatial context for consistent player tracking and unfragmented tracklet prediction. Our results show considerable improvements in both the IDsw and IDF1 metrics on the two available broadcast ice hockey datasets.

Our method combines generalised Bayesian inference with filtering methods such as the extended and ensemble Kalman filter. We use the former to show robustness and the latter to ensure computational efficiency in the case of nonlinear models. Our method matches or outperforms other robust filtering methods (such as those based on variational Bayes) at a much lower computational cost. We show this empirically on a range of filtering problems with outlier measurements, such as object tracking, state estimation in high-dimensional chaotic systems, and online learning of neural networks.

How to achieve more comprehensive fusion of information from the two modalities at a lower cost has been an issue that researchers have been exploring. Inspired by visual prompt learning, we designed a novel two-stream RGB-T tracking architecture based on cross-modal mutual prompt learning, and used this model as a teacher to guide a one-stream student model for rapid learning through knowledge distillation techniques. Extensive experiments have shown that, compared to similar RGB-T trackers, our designed teacher model achieved the highest precision rate, while the student model, with comparable precision rate to the teacher model, realized an inference speed more than three times faster than the teacher model.(Codes will be available if accepted.)

We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.

However present-day FVA software are complex, time consuming, equipment dependent and expensive. Developing countries struggle to gain access to this gateway to a secure haven. The term forensic pertains the application of scientific methods to the investigation of crime through post-processing, whereas surveillance is the close monitoring of real-time feeds.
  The principle objective of this Final Year Project was to develop an efficient and effective FVA Software, addressing the shortcomings through a stringent and systematic review of scholarly research papers, online databases and legal documentation. The scope spans multiple object detection, multiple object tracking, anomaly detection, activity recognition, tampering detection, general and specific image enhancement and video synopsis.
  Methods employed include many machine learning techniques, GPU acceleration and efficient, integrated architecture development both for real-time and postprocessing. For this CNN, GMM, multithreading and OpenCV C++ coding were used. The implications of the proposed methodology would rapidly speed up the FVA process especially through the novel video synopsis research arena. This project has resulted in three research outcomes Moving Object Based Collision Free Video Synopsis, Forensic and Surveillance Analytic Tool Architecture and Tampering Detection Inter-Frame Forgery.
  The results include forensic and surveillance panel outcomes with emphasis on video synopsis and Sri Lankan context. Principal conclusions include the optimization and efficient algorithm integration to overcome limitations in processing power, memory and compromise between real-time performance and accuracy.

This capability requires instance tracking in real-world 3D scenes from egocentric videos (IT3DEgo). We explore this problem by first introducing a new benchmark dataset, consisting of RGB and depth videos, per-frame camera pose, and instance-level annotations in both 2D camera and 3D world coordinates. We present an evaluation protocol which evaluates tracking performance in 3D coordinates with two settings for enrolling instances to track: (1) single-view online enrollment where an instance is specified on-the-fly based on the human wearer's interactions. and (2) multi-view pre-enrollment where images of an instance to be tracked are stored in memory ahead of time. To address IT3DEgo, we first re-purpose methods from relevant areas, e.g., single object tracking (SOT) -- running SOT methods to track instances in 2D frames and lifting them to 3D using camera pose and depth. We also present a simple method that leverages pretrained segmentation and detection models to generate proposals from RGB frames and match proposals with enrolled instance images. Our experiments show that our method (with no finetuning) significantly outperforms SOT-based approaches in the egocentric setting. We conclude by arguing that the problem of egocentric instance tracking is made easier by leveraging camera pose and using a 3D allocentric (world) coordinate representation.

Recent similar procedural approaches have proven successful for image question answering, but videos remain challenging: we provide ProViQ with modules intended for video understanding, allowing it to generalize to a wide variety of videos. This code generation framework additionally enables ProViQ to perform other video tasks in addition to question answering, such as multi-object tracking or basic video editing.

While conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are adept at tracking diverse objects, toddlers pose unique challenges due to their unpredictable movements, various poses, and similar appearance. Tracking toddlers in indoor environments introduces additional complexities such as occlusions and limited fields of view. In this paper, we address the challenges of MTT and propose MTTSort, a customized method built upon the DeepSort algorithm. MTTSort is designed to track multiple toddlers in indoor videos accurately. Our contributions include discussing the primary challenges in MTT, introducing a genetic algorithm to optimize hyperparameters, proposing an accurate tracking algorithm, and curating the MTTrack dataset using unbiased AI co-labeling techniques. We quantitatively compare MTTSort to state-of-the-art MOT methods on MTTrack, DanceTrack, and MOT15 datasets. In our evaluation, the proposed method outperformed other MOT methods, achieving 0.98, 0.68, and 0.98 in multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA), and iterative and discriminative framework 1 (IDF1) metrics, respectively.

Perception systems can use on-board sensors only or be in cooperation with other vehicles or with roadside units. In any case, the performance of perception systems has to be evaluated against ground-truth data, which is a particularly tedious task and requires numerous manual operations. In this article, we propose a novel semi-automatic method for pseudo ground-truth estimation. The principle consists in carrying out experiments with several vehicles equipped with LiDAR sensors and with fixed perception systems located at the roadside in order to collaboratively build reference dynamic data. The method is based on grid mapping and in particular on the elaboration of a background map that holds relevant information that remains valid during a whole dataset sequence. Data from all agents is converted in time-stamped observations grids. A data fusion method that manages uncertainties combines the background map with observations to produce dynamic reference information at each instant. Several datasets have been acquired with three experimental vehicles and a roadside unit. An evaluation of this method is finally provided in comparison to a handmade ground truth.

In this study, we propose a pipeline for evaluating the significance of roadside billboards in videos captured from a driver's perspective. We have collected and annotated a new BillboardLamac dataset, comprising eight videos captured by drivers driving through a predefined path wearing eye-tracking devices. The dataset includes annotations of billboards, including 154 unique IDs and 155 thousand bounding boxes, as well as eye fixation data. We evaluate various object tracking methods in combination with a YOLOv8 detector to identify billboard advertisements with the best approach achieving 38.5 HOTA on BillboardLamac. Additionally, we train a random forest classifier to classify billboards into three classes based on the length of driver fixations achieving 75.8% test accuracy. An analysis of the trained classifier reveals that the duration of billboard visibility, its saliency, and size are the most influential features when assessing billboard significance.

A novel nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework alongside a global wind turbine path planner is proposed to achieve distance-optimal coverage for wind turbine inspection. Unlike traditional MPC formulations, visual tracking NMPC (VT-NMPC) is designed to track an inspection surface, instead of a position and heading trajectory, thereby circumventing the need to provide an accurate predefined trajectory for the drone. An additional capability of the proposed VT-NMPC method is that by incorporating inspection requirements as visual tracking costs to minimize, it naturally achieves the inspection task successfully while respecting the physical constraints of the drone. Multiple simulation runs and real-world tests demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed automated inspection framework, which outperforms the traditional MPC designs, by providing full coverage of the target wind turbine blades as well as its robustness to changing wind conditions. The implementation codes are open-sourced.

However, many existing Simultaneous Localization, Mapping and Moving Object Tracking (SLAMMOT) methods focus solely on estimating specific object poses and lack estimation of object scales and are unable to effectively track unknown objects. In this paper, we propose a novel SLAM backend that unifies ego-motion tracking, rigid object motion tracking, and modeling within a joint optimization framework. In the perception part, we designed a pixel-level asynchronous object tracker (AOT) based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and DeAOT, enabling the tracker to effectively track target unknown objects guided by various predefined tasks and prompts. In the modeling part, we present a novel object-centric quadric parameterization to unify both static and dynamic object initialization and optimization. Subsequently, in the part of object state estimation, we propose a tightly coupled optimization model for object pose and scale estimation, incorporating hybrids constraints into a novel dual sliding window optimization framework for joint estimation. To our knowledge, we are the first to tightly couple object pose tracking with light-weight modeling of dynamic and static objects using quadric. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on simulation datasets and real-world datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art robustness and accuracy in motion estimation and modeling. Our system showcases the potential application of object perception in complex dynamic scenes.

In this paper, we design two variational Bayesian trackers that effectively track multiple targets in cluttered environments within a sensor network. We first present a centralised sensor fusion scheme, which involves transmitting sensor data to a fusion center. Then, we develop a distributed version leveraging the average consensus algorithm, which is theoretically equivalent to the centralised sensor fusion tracker and requires only local message passing with neighbouring sensors. In addition, we empirically verify that our proposed distributed variational tracker performs on par with the centralised version with equal tracking accuracy. Simulation results show that our distributed multi-target tracker outperforms the suboptimal distributed sensor fusion strategy that fuses each sensor's posterior based on arithmetic sensor fusion and an average consensus strategy.

How to achieve a more comprehensive fusion of information from the two modalities with fewer computational costs has been a problem that re-searchers have been exploring. Recently, with the rise of prompt learning in computer vision, we can better transfer knowledge from visual large models to downstream tasks. Considering the strong complementarity between visible and thermal modalities, we propose a tracking architecture based on mutual prompt learning between the two modalities. We also design a lightweight prompter that incorporates attention mechanisms in two dimensions to transfer information from one modality to the other with lower computational costs, embedding it into each layer of the backbone. Extensive ex-periments have demonstrated that our proposed tracking ar-chitecture is effective and efficient, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high running speeds.

In recent years, several existing and new applications have attempted to integrate deep-learning based frameworks for this task, but most of them still heavily rely on consecutive frame based tracking embedded in their architecture or other premises that hinder generalized learning. To address this issue, we aimed to develop a new deep-learning based tracking method that relies solely on the assumption that cells can be tracked based on their spatio-temporal neighborhood, without restricting it to consecutive frames. The proposed method has the additional benefit that the motion patterns of the cells can be learned completely by the predictor without any prior assumptions, and it has the potential to handle a large number of video frames with heavy artifacts. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through biologically motivated validation strategies and compared against multiple state-of-the-art cell tracking methods.

However, with only an onboard RGB camera, it is still a challenging work for a quadruped manipulator to track the motion of a dynamic object moving with unknown and changing velocities. To address this problem, this manuscript proposes a novel image-based visual servoing (IBVS) approach consisting of three elements: a spherical projection model, a robust super-twisting observer, and a model predictive controller (MPC). The spherical projection model decouples the visual error of the dynamic target into linear and angular ones. Then, with the presence of the visual error, the robustness of the observer is exploited to estimate the unknown and changing velocities of the dynamic target without depth estimation. Finally, the estimated velocity is fed into the model predictive controller (MPC) to generate joint torques for the quadruped manipulator to track the motion of the dynamical target. The proposed approach is validated through hardware experiments and the experimental results illustrate the approach's effectiveness in improving the autonomy of the quadruped manipulator.

Traditional model-based tracking approaches incorporate the geometric effect of object- and ego motion between frames with a geometric motion model. Inspired by this, we propose S.T.A.R.-Track, which uses a novel latent motion model (LMM) to additionally adjust object queries to account for changes in viewing direction and lighting conditions directly in the latent space, while still modeling the geometric motion explicitly. Combined with a novel learnable track embedding that aids in modeling the existence probability of tracks, this results in a generic tracking framework that can be integrated with any query-based detector. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the benefits of our approach, showing state-of-the-art performance for DETR3D-based trackers while drastically reducing the number of identity switches of tracks at the same time.

Based on these findings, we then provide solutions to various issues on exploiting spatio-temporal correlations in a sequence of sensor recordings by presenting a novel Recurrent Neural Network unit utilizing Transformer mechanisms. Within this unit, object encodings are tracked across consecutive frames by correlating key-query pairs derived from sensor inputs and memory states, respectively. We then use resulting tracking patterns to obtain scene dynamics and regress velocities. In a last step, the memory state of the Recurrent Neural Network is projected based on extracted velocity estimates to resolve aforementioned spatio-temporal misalignment.

We propose to cast the problem of multiple object tracking as learning the frame-wise associations between detections in consecutive frames. To this end, we propose differentiable soft object assignment for object association, making it possible to learn features tailored to object association with differentiable end-to-end training. With this training approach in hand, we develop an appearance-based model for learning instance-aware object features used to construct a cost matrix based on the pairwise distances between the object features. We train our model using temporal and multi-view data, where we obtain association pseudo-labels using optical flow and disparity information. Unlike most self-supervised tracking methods that rely on pretext tasks for learning the feature correspondences, our method is directly optimized for cross-object association in complex scenarios. As such, the proposed method offers a reidentification-based MOT approach that is robust to training hyperparameters and does not suffer from local minima, which are a challenge in self-supervised methods. We evaluate our proposed model on the KITTI, Waymo, nuScenes, and Argoverse datasets, consistently improving over other unsupervised methods ($7.8\%$ improvement in association accuracy on nuScenes).

It can obtain good tracking results when using excellent detectors but it may associate wrong targets when facing overlapping and low-confidence detections. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-object tracker based on shape constraint and confidence named SCTracker. In the data association stage, an Intersection of Union distance with shape constraints is applied to calculate the cost matrix between tracks and detections, which can effectively avoid the track tracking to the wrong target with the similar position but inconsistent shape, so as to improve the accuracy of data association. Additionally, the Kalman Filter based on the detection confidence is used to update the motion state to improve the tracking performance when the detection has low confidence. Experimental results on MOT 17 dataset show that the proposed method can effectively improve the tracking performance of multi-object tracking.

However, their re-identification accuracy still falls short compared to their supervised counterparts. We hypothesize that this drawback results from formulating self-supervised objectives that are limited to single frames or frame pairs. Such formulations do not capture sufficient visual appearance variations to facilitate learning consistent re-identification features for autonomous driving when the frame rate is low or object dynamics are high. In this work, we propose a training objective that enables self-supervised learning of re-identification features from multiple sequential frames by enforcing consistent association scores across short and long timescales. We perform extensive evaluations demonstrating that re-identification features trained from longer sequences significantly reduce ID switches on standard autonomous driving datasets compared to existing self-supervised learning methods, which are limited to training on frame pairs. Using our proposed SubCo loss function, we set the new state-of-the-art among self-supervised methods and even perform on par with fully supervised learning methods.

Once detected, it is important to monitor and track these vessels until a necessary intervention occurs. To achieve this, track association algorithms are used, which take sequential observations comprising geological and motion parameters of the vessels and associate them with respective vessels. The spatial and temporal variations inherent in these sequential observations make the association task challenging for traditional multi-object tracking algorithms. Additionally, the presence of overlapping tracks and missing data can further complicate the trajectory tracking process. To address these challenges, in this study, we approach this tracking task as a multivariate time series problem and introduce a 1D CNN-LSTM architecture-based framework for track association. This special neural network architecture can capture the spatial patterns as well as the long-term temporal relations that exist among the sequential observations. During the training process, it learns and builds the trajectory for each of these underlying vessels. Once trained, the proposed framework takes the marine vessel's location and motion data collected through the Automatic Identification System (AIS) as input and returns the most likely vessel track as output in real-time. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we utilize an AIS dataset containing observations from 327 vessels traveling in a specific geographic region. We measure the performance of our proposed framework using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. When compared with other competitive neural network architectures our approach demonstrates a superior tracking performance.

This work proposes a system for robustly optimizing the pose of cameras and objects even in the presence of symmetric objects. We classify objects into three categories depending on their symmetry characteristics, which is efficient and effective in that it allows to deal with general objects and the objects in the same category can be associated with the same type of ambiguity. Then we extract only the unambiguous parameters corresponding to each category and use them in data association and joint optimization of the camera and object pose. The proposed approach provides significant robustness to the SLAM performance by removing the ambiguous parameters and utilizing as much useful geometric information as possible. Comparison with baseline algorithms confirms the superior performance of the proposed system in terms of object tracking and pose estimation, even in challenging scenarios where the baseline fails.

In this work, we develop a multi-modality tracker that fuses information from visual appearance and geometry to estimate object poses. The algorithm extends our previous method ICG, which uses geometry, to additionally consider surface appearance. In general, object surfaces contain local characteristics from text, graphics, and patterns, as well as global differences from distinct materials and colors. To incorporate this visual information, two modalities are developed. For local characteristics, keypoint features are used to minimize distances between points from keyframes and the current image. For global differences, a novel region approach is developed that considers multiple regions on the object surface. In addition, it allows the modeling of external geometries. Experiments on the YCB-Video and OPT datasets demonstrate that our approach ICG+ performs best on both datasets, outperforming both conventional and deep learning-based methods. At the same time, the algorithm is highly efficient and runs at more than 300 Hz. The source code of our tracker is publicly available.

We embed each frame by an unordered set of proposal feature vectors, a representation that is natural for object detection or tracking systems, and formulate the sequential ordering by predicting frame transition probabilities in a transformer-based multi-frame architecture whose complexity scales less than quadratic with respect to the sequence length. Extensive evaluations on the BDD100K, nuImages, and MOT17 datasets show that our TempO pre-training approach outperforms single-frame self-supervised learning methods as well as supervised transfer learning initialization strategies, achieving an improvement of +0.7% in mAP for object detection and +2.0% in the HOTA score for multi-object tracking.

MOT remains a challenging task as noisy and confusing detection results often hinder the final performance. Furthermore, most existing research are focusing on improving detection algorithms and association strategies. As such, we propose a novel framework that can effectively predict and mask-out the noisy and confusing detection results before associating the objects into trajectories. In particular, we formulate such "bad" detection results as a sequence of events and adopt the spatio-temporal point process}to model such events. Traditionally, the occurrence rate in a point process is characterized by an explicitly defined intensity function, which depends on the prior knowledge of some specific tasks. Thus, designing a proper model is expensive and time-consuming, with also limited ability to generalize well. To tackle this problem, we adopt the convolutional recurrent neural network (conv-RNN) to instantiate the point process, where its intensity function is automatically modeled by the training data. Furthermore, we show that our method captures both temporal and spatial evolution, which is essential in modeling events for MOT. Experimental results demonstrate notable improvements in addressing noisy and confusing detection results in MOT datasets. An improved state-of-the-art performance is achieved by incorporating our baseline MOT algorithm with the spatio-temporal point process model.

When appearance features are unreliable and geometric features are confused by irregular motions, applying conventional Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) methods may generate unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, our C-BIoU tracker adds buffers to expand the matching space of detections and tracks, which mitigates the effect of irregular motions in two aspects: one is to directly match identical but non-overlapping detections and tracks in adjacent frames, and the other is to compensate for the motion estimation bias in the matching space. In addition, to reduce the risk of overexpansion of the matching space, cascaded matching is employed: first matching alive tracks and detections with a small buffer, and then matching unmatched tracks and detections with a large buffer. Despite its simplicity, our C-BIoU tracker works surprisingly well and achieves state-of-the-art results on MOT datasets that focus on irregular motions and indistinguishable appearances. Moreover, the C-BIoU tracker is the dominant component for our 2-nd place solution in the CVPR'22 SoccerNet MOT and ECCV'22 MOTComplex DanceTrack challenges. Finally, we analyze the limitation of our C-BIoU tracker in ablation studies and discuss its application scope.

Unlike in common multiple object tracking, in microbial live-cell experiments cells are growing, moving, and dividing over time, to form cell colonies that are densely packed in mono-layer structures. With increasing cell numbers, following the precise cell-cell associations correctly over many generations becomes more and more challenging, due to the massively increasing number of possible associations.
  To tackle this challenge, we propose a fast parameter-free cell tracking approach, which consists of activity-prioritized nearest neighbor assignment of growing cells and a combinatorial solver that assigns splitting mother cells to their daughters. As input for the tracking, Omnipose is utilized for instance segmentation. Unlike conventional nearest-neighbor-based tracking approaches, the assignment steps of our proposed method are based on a Gaussian activity-based metric, predicting the cell-specific migration probability, thereby limiting the number of erroneous assignments. In addition to being a building block for cell tracking, the proposed activity map is a standalone tracking-free metric for indicating cell activity. Finally, we perform a quantitative analysis of the tracking accuracy for different frame rates, to inform life scientists about a suitable (in terms of tracking performance) choice of the frame rate for their cultivation experiments, when cell tracks are the desired key outcome.

We combine this similarity learning with multiple existing object detectors to build Quasi-Dense Tracking (QDTrack), which does not require displacement regression or motion priors. We find that the resulting distinctive feature space admits a simple nearest neighbor search at inference time for object association. In addition, we show that our similarity learning scheme is not limited to video data, but can learn effective instance similarity even from static input, enabling a competitive tracking performance without training on videos or using tracking supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on a wide variety of popular MOT benchmarks. We find that, despite its simplicity, QDTrack rivals the performance of state-of-the-art tracking methods on all benchmarks and sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale BDD100K MOT benchmark, while introducing negligible computational overhead to the detector.

It is a vital downstream method applied to many tasks, such as motion segmentation and object tracking. However, there are always occlusion points between two consecutive point clouds, whether from the sparsity data sampling or real-world occlusion. In this paper, we focus on addressing occlusion issues in scene flow by the semantic self-similarity and motion consistency of the moving objects. We propose a GMA3D module based on the transformer framework, which utilizes local and global semantic similarity to infer the motion information of occluded points from the motion information of local and global non-occluded points respectively, and then uses an offset aggregator to aggregate them. Our module is the first to apply the transformer-based architecture to gauge the scene flow occlusion problem on point clouds. Experiments show that our GMA3D can solve the occlusion problem in the scene flow, especially in the real scene. We evaluated the proposed method on the occluded version of point cloud datasets and get state-of-the-art results on the real scene KITTI dataset. To testify that GMA3D is still beneficial to non-occluded scene flow, we also conducted experiments on non-occluded version datasets and achieved promising performance on FlyThings3D and KITTI. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GMA3D-E100.

They range from simple articulated objects to complex mechanical systems. However, despite their relevance, most model-based 3D tracking methods only consider rigid objects. To overcome this limitation, we propose a flexible framework that allows the extension of existing 6DoF algorithms to kinematic structures. Our approach focuses on methods that employ Newton-like optimization techniques, which are widely used in object tracking. The framework considers both tree-like and closed kinematic structures and allows a flexible configuration of joints and constraints. To project equations from individual rigid bodies to a multi-body system, Jacobians are used. For closed kinematic chains, a novel formulation that features Lagrange multipliers is developed. In a detailed mathematical proof, we show that our constraint formulation leads to an exact kinematic solution and converges in a single iteration. Based on the proposed framework, we extend ICG, which is a state-of-the-art rigid object tracking algorithm, to multi-body tracking. For the evaluation, we create a highly-realistic synthetic dataset that features a large number of sequences and various robots. Based on this dataset, we conduct a wide variety of experiments that demonstrate the excellent performance of the developed framework and our multi-body tracker.

However, due to the separate models for detection and association, the tracking results are not optimal.Moreover, the speed is limited by some cumbersome association methods to achieve high tracking performance. In this work, we propose an end-to-end MOT method, with a Gaussian filter-inspired dynamic search region refinement module to dynamically filter and refine the search region by considering both the template information from the past frames and the detection results from the current frame with little computational burden, and a lightweight attention-based tracking head to achieve the effective fine-grained instance association. Extensive experiments and ablation study on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance with reasonable speed.

This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.

Computer vision systems capable of long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types. While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and PromptTrack. All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking.

This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

However, real-world applications face significant occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection features from both the regression and classification branches of an object detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions, integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes. By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded environments where occlusions are prevalent.

However, in some real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association. Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

While monitoring tasks have traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space (object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models. However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use and further development.

We propose a fundamentally different approach using reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2 that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules for memory control in visual object tracking.

It capitalises on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification (GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning (including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly more from simulated data).

Thermal sensors enhance recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution for real-world surveillance applications.

In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

The method is versatile, predicting any kind of road anomalies, such as potholes, bumps, debris, etc., unlike direct observation methods that rely on training visual detectors of those cases. The method operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the anomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle. Anomalies are detected predictively, i.e., before a vehicle encounters them, which allows to pre-configure low-level vehicle systems (such as chassis) or to plan an avoidance maneuver in case of autonomous driving. A challenge is that the signal coming from camera-based tracking of a preceding vehicle may be weak and disturbed by camera ego motion due to vibrations affecting the ego vehicle. Therefore, we propose an efficient method to compensate camera pitch rotation by an iterative robust estimator. Our experiments on both controlled setup and normal traffic conditions show that road anomalies can be detected reliably at a distance even in challenging cases where the ego vehicle traverses imperfect road surfaces. The method is effective and performs in real time on standard consumer hardware.

Existing frame reconstruction methods, while efficient, neglect the value of direct involvement of multiple reference frames for reconstruction and decision-making aspects, especially in complex situations such as occlusion or fast movement. In this paper, we introduce a Dynamic Memory Prediction (DMP) framework that innovatively utilizes multiple reference frames to concisely and directly enhance frame reconstruction. Its core component is a Reference Frame Memory Engine that dynamically selects frames based on object pixel features to improve tracking accuracy. In addition, a Bidirectional Target Prediction Network is built to utilize multiple reference frames to improve the robustness of the model. Through experiments, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised techniques on two fine-grained video object tracking tasks: object segmentation and keypoint tracking.

However, maintaining tracking continuity and consistency remains a significant challenge. Traditional detection-assignment tracking methods struggle with false positives, false negatives, and frequent identity switches, leading to degraded counting accuracy and making in-depth analysis impossible. This paper introduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory continuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring. Our method builds on the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) framework, replacing the original bounding-box assignment with a point-distance metric. The algorithm is enhanced with three cost-effective techniques: camera motion compensation, altitude-aware assignment, and classification-based trajectory validation. Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use spatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational efficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine object tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed method is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting errors to 23% and 15%, respectively. The results also indicate a significant reduction of identity switches while maintaining high tracking accuracy, outperforming baseline online trackers and even an offline greedy optimisation method.

Their performance heavily depends on the quality of template features, which becomes increasingly challenging to maintain in complex scenarios involving target deformation, occlusion, and background clutter. While existing spatiotemporal memory-based trackers emphasize memory capacity expansion, they lack effective mechanisms for dynamic feature selection and adaptive fusion. To address this gap, we propose a Dynamic Attention Mechanism in Spatiotemporal Memory Network (DASTM) with two key innovations: 1) A differentiable dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively adjusts channel-spatial attention weights by analyzing spatiotemporal correlations between the templates and memory features; 2) A lightweight gating network that autonomously allocates computational resources based on target motion states, prioritizing high-discriminability features in challenging scenarios. Extensive evaluations on OTB-2015, VOT 2018, LaSOT, and GOT-10K benchmarks demonstrate our DASTM's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance in success rate, robustness, and real-time efficiency, thereby offering a novel solution for real-time tracking in complex environments.

This formulation is elegant and powerful, but unable to tackle dynamic scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Dynamic Point Maps (DPM), extending standard point maps to support 4D tasks such as motion segmentation, scene flow estimation, 3D object tracking, and 2D correspondence. Our key intuition is that, when time is introduced, there are several possible spatial and time references that can be used to define the point maps. We identify a minimal subset of such combinations that can be regressed by a network to solve the sub tasks mentioned above. We train a DPM predictor on a mixture of synthetic and real data and evaluate it across diverse benchmarks for video depth prediction, dynamic point cloud reconstruction, 3D scene flow and object pose tracking, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

However, existing algorithms usually only generate single-stage fusion features for state decision, which ignore that diverse kinds of features are required for identifying and locating the object, limiting the robustness and precision of tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel target-aware Bidirectional Fusion transformer (BFTrans) for UAV tracking. Specifically, we first present a two-stream fusion network based on linear self and cross attentions, which can combine the shallow and the deep features from both forward and backward directions, providing the adjusted local details for location and global semantics for recognition. Besides, a target-aware positional encoding strategy is designed for the above fusion model, which is helpful to perceive the object-related attributes during the fusion phase. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on several popular UAV benchmarks, including UAV-123, UAV20L and UAVTrack112. Massive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can exceed other state-of-the-art trackers and run with an average speed of 30.5 FPS on embedded platform, which is appropriate for practical drone deployments.

While other research on MOT dedicated to aerial videos primarily focuses on the academic aspect by developing sophisticated algorithms, there is a lack of attention to the practical aspect of these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time MOT framework that integrates Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for efficient and fault-tolerant video stream processing, along with state-of-the-art deep learning models YOLOv8/YOLOv10 and BYTETRACK/BoTSORT for accurate object detection and tracking. Our work highlights the importance of not only the advanced algorithms but also the integration of these methods with scalable and distributed systems. By leveraging these technologies, our system achieves a HOTA of 48.14 and a MOTA of 43.51 on the Visdrone2019-MOT test set while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 28 FPS on a single GPU. Our work demonstrates the potential of big data technologies and deep learning for addressing the challenges of MOT in UAV applications.

However, automation of the inspection task is a challenging problem as it requires precise navigation to capture images from optimal distances and viewing angles.
  This paper presents a novel localization pipeline that directly integrates PV module detection with UAV navigation, allowing precise positioning during inspection. Detections are used to identify the power plant structures in the image and associate these with the power plant model. We define visually recognizable anchor points for the initial association and use object tracking to discern global associations. We present three distinct methods for visual segmentation of PV modules based on traditional computer vision, deep learning, and their fusion, and we evaluate their performance in relation to the proposed localization pipeline.
  The presented methods were verified and evaluated using custom aerial inspection data sets, demonstrating their robustness and applicability for real-time navigation. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of the power plant model's precision on the localization methods.

In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.

The perception module is responsible for perceiving the environment, including static and dynamic objects, while the prediction module is responsible for predicting the future behavior of these objects. These modules are typically divided into three tasks: object detection, object tracking, and motion prediction. Traditionally, these tasks are developed and optimized independently, with outputs passed sequentially from one to the next. However, this approach has significant limitations: computational resources are not shared across tasks, the lack of joint optimization can amplify errors as they propagate throughout the pipeline, and uncertainty is rarely propagated between modules, resulting in significant information loss. To address these challenges, the joint perception and prediction paradigm has emerged, integrating perception and prediction into a unified model through multi-task learning. This strategy not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods, but also enables the three tasks to have direct access to raw sensor data, allowing richer and more nuanced environmental interpretations. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of joint perception and prediction for autonomous driving. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes approaches based on input representation, scene context modeling, and output representation, highlighting their contributions and limitations. Additionally, we present a qualitative analysis and quantitative comparison of existing methods. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on identified gaps in the state-of-the-art.

Moreover, the introduction of high quality legged robots into workplaces highlighted the crucial role of a robust, fully autonomous safety solution for robots to be viable in shared spaces or in co-existence with humans. This article establishes for the first time ever an innovative Detect-Track-and-Avoid Architecture (DTAA) to enhance safety and overall mission performance. The proposed novel architectyre has the merit ot integrating object detection using YOLOv8, utilizing Ultralytics embedded object tracking, and state estimation of tracked objects through Kalman filters. Moreover, a novel heuristic clustering is employed to facilitate active avoidance of multiple closely positioned objects with similar velocities, creating sets of unsafe spaces for the Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) to navigate around. The NMPC identifies the most hazardous unsafe space, considering not only their current positions but also their predicted future locations. In the sequel, the NMPC calculates maneuvers to guide the robot along a path planned by D$^{*}_{+}$ towards its intended destination, while maintaining a safe distance to all identified obstacles. The efficacy of the novelly suggested DTAA framework is being validated by Real-life experiments featuring a Boston Dynamics Spot robot that demonstrates the robot's capability to consistently maintain a safe distance from humans in dynamic subterranean, urban indoor, and outdoor environments.

However, the challenges of acquiring and processing long-term, ecologically relevant data in wild settings have constrained the scope of behavioural research. The increasing availability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), coupled with advances in machine learning, has opened new opportunities for wildlife monitoring using aerial tracking. However, limited availability of datasets with wild animals in natural habitats has hindered progress in automated computer vision solutions for long-term animal tracking. Here we introduce BuckTales, the first large-scale UAV dataset designed to solve multi-object tracking (MOT) and re-identification (Re-ID) problem in wild animals, specifically the mating behaviour (or lekking) of blackbuck antelopes. Collected in collaboration with biologists, the MOT dataset includes over 1.2 million annotations including 680 tracks across 12 high-resolution (5.4K) videos, each averaging 66 seconds and featuring 30 to 130 individuals. The Re-ID dataset includes 730 individuals captured with two UAVs simultaneously. The dataset is designed to drive scalable, long-term animal behaviour tracking using multiple camera sensors. By providing baseline performance with two detectors, and benchmarking several state-of-the-art tracking methods, our dataset reflects the real-world challenges of tracking wild animals in socially and ecologically relevant contexts. In making these data widely available, we hope to catalyze progress in MOT and Re-ID for wild animals, fostering insights into animal behaviour, conservation efforts, and ecosystem dynamics through automated, long-term monitoring.

Such a formulation of source coding is an alternative approach to the traditional framework and is inspired by an object tracking problem over proximity sensor networks. We define a \textit{multiset combinatorial Gray code} as a mulitset code with fixed multiset cardinality that possesses combinatorial Gray code characteristic. For source codes that are organized as a grid, namely an integer lattice, we propose a solution by first constructing a mapping from the grid to the alphabet set, the codes are then defined as the images of rectangular blocks in the grid of fixed dimensions. We refer to the mapping as a \textit{color mapping} and the code as a \textit{color multiset code}. We propose the idea of product multiset code that enables us to construct codes for high dimensional grids based on 1-dimensional (1D) grids. We provide a detailed analysis of color multiset codes on 1D grids, focusing on codes that require the minimal number of colors. To illustrate the application of such a coding scheme, we consider an object tracking problem on 2D grids and show its efficiency, which comes from exploiting transmission parallelism.

Our system utilizes a mobile wireless communication tag attached to personal belongings as proof of opt-in and as a means of localizing tag carriers in video footage. Specifically, the on-ground positions of the wireless tag are first tracked over time using the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The tag trajectory is then matched against visual tracking results for pedestrians found in videos to identify the tag carrier. Technically, we devise a dedicated trajectory matching technique based on constrained linear optimization, as well as a novel calibration technique that handles wireless tag-camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning for the UKF, which mitigates the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) issue in wireless localization. We implemented the proposed opt-in camera system using ultra-wideband (UWB) devices and an off-the-shelf webcam. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can perform opt-in recording of individuals in real-time at 10 fps, with reliable identification accuracy in crowds of 8-23 people in a confined space.

Dynamic target representation adaptation against distractors is challenging due to the limited discriminative capabilities of prevailing trackers. We present a new visual Prompting mechanism for generic Visual Object Tracking (PiVOT) to address this issue. PiVOT proposes a prompt generation network with the pre-trained foundation model CLIP to automatically generate and refine visual prompts, enabling the transfer of foundation model knowledge for tracking. While CLIP offers broad category-level knowledge, the tracker, trained on instance-specific data, excels at recognizing unique object instances. Thus, PiVOT first compiles a visual prompt highlighting potential target locations. To transfer the knowledge of CLIP to the tracker, PiVOT leverages CLIP to refine the visual prompt based on the similarities between candidate objects and the reference templates across potential targets. Once the visual prompt is refined, it can better highlight potential target locations, thereby reducing irrelevant prompt information. With the proposed prompting mechanism, the tracker can generate improved instance-aware feature maps through the guidance of the visual prompt, thus effectively reducing distractors. The proposed method does not involve CLIP during training, thereby keeping the same training complexity and preserving the generalization capability of the pretrained foundation model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks indicate that PiVOT, using the proposed prompting method can suppress distracting objects and enhance the tracker.

Traditional tracking-by-detection methods, while effective, often require extensive tuning and lack generalizability.

We propose a novel approach, McByte, which incorporates a temporally propagated segmentation mask as a strong association cue within a tracking-by-detection framework. By combining bounding box and propagated mask information, McByte enhances robustness and generalizability without per-sequence tuning. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets - DanceTrack, MOT17, SoccerNet-tracking 2022, and KITTI-tracking - McByte demonstrates performance gain in all cases examined. At the same time, it outperforms existing mask-based methods. Implementation code will be provided upon acceptance.

When tracking objects detected by a camera, it often occurs that the same object is assigned different IDs in consecutive frames, especially when objects are close to each other or overlapping. To address this issue, we introduce Gr-IoU, which takes into account the 3D structure of the scene. Gr-IoU transforms traditional bounding boxes from the image space to the ground plane using the vanishing point geometry. The IoU calculated with these transformed bounding boxes is more sensitive to the front-to-back relationships of objects, thereby improving data association accuracy and reducing ID switches. We evaluated our Gr-IoU method on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets, which contain diverse tracking scenarios including crowded scenes and sequences with frequent occlusions. Experimental results demonstrated that Gr-IoU outperforms conventional real-time methods without appearance features.

Typical estimation approaches include optical flow (OF), which approximates the apparent motion instantaneously in a scene, and multiple object tracking (MOT), which tracks the motion of subjects over time. Often, the motion of objects in a scene is governed by some underlying dynamical system which could be inferred by analyzing the motion of groups of objects. Standard motion analyses, however, are not designed to intuit flow dynamics from trajectory data, making such measurements difficult in practice. The goal of this work is to extend gradient-based dynamical systems analyses to real-world applications characterized by complex, feature-rich image sequences with imperfect tracers. The tracer trajectories are tracked using deep vision networks and gradients are approximated using Lagrangian gradient regression (LGR), a tool designed to estimate spatial gradients from sparse data. From gradients, dynamical features such as regions of coherent rotation and transport barriers are identified. The proposed approach is affordably implemented and enables advanced studies including the motion analysis of two distinct object classes in a single image sequence. Two examples of the method are presented on data sets for which standard gradient-based analyses do not apply.

The emergence of data sets that emphasize robust reidentification, such as DanceTrack, has highlighted the need for effective solutions. While memory-based approaches have shown promise, they often suffer from high computational complexity and memory usage due to storing feature at every single frame. In this paper, we propose a novel memory-based approach that selectively stores critical features based on object motion and overlapping awareness, aiming to enhance efficiency while minimizing redundancy. As a result, our method not only store longer temporal information with limited number of stored features in the memory, but also diversify states of a particular object to enhance the association performance. Our approach significantly improves over MOTRv2 in the DanceTrack test set, demonstrating a gain of 2.0% AssA score and 2.1% in IDF1 score.

In contrast to conventional detectors that only provide bounding boxes, our modified YOLOX architecture is extended to output multiple appearance attributes, including clothing color, clothing style, and motion direction, alongside the bounding boxes. These feature cues, together with a ReID network, form complementary embeddings that substantially improve association accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate stronger post-processing strategies, such as global linking and Gaussian Smoothing Process interpolation, to handle missing associations and detections. During online tracking, we define a measurement-to-track distance function that jointly considers IoU, direction, color, style, and ReID similarity. This design enables FeatureSORT to maintain consistent identities through longer occlusions while reducing identity switches. Extensive experiments on standard MOT benchmarks demonstrate that FeatureSORT achieves state-of-the-art online performance, with MOTA scores of 79.7 on MOT16, 80.6 on MOT17, 77.9 on MOT20, and 92.2 on DanceTrack, underscoring the effectiveness of feature-enriched detection and modular post processing in advancing multi-object tracking.

Both provide high confidence for drone detections, and eliminating false detections requires efficient algorithms and approaches. Our previous work, which uses YOLOv5, uses both real and synthetic data and a Kalman-based tracker to track the detections and increase their confidence using temporal information. Our current work improves on the previous approach by combining several improvements. We used a more diverse dataset combining multiple sources and combined with synthetic samples chosen from a large synthetic dataset based on the error analysis of the base model. Also, to obtain more resilient confidence scores for objects, we introduced a classification component that discriminates whether the object is a drone or not. Finally, we developed a more advanced scoring algorithm for object tracking that we use to adjust localization confidence. Furthermore, the proposed technique won 1st Place in the Drone vs. Bird Challenge (Workshop on Small-Drone Surveillance, Detection and Counteraction Techniques at ICIAP 2021).

This association relies on matching motion and appearance patterns of detected objects. This task is especially hard in case of scenarios involving dynamic and non-linear motion patterns. In this paper, we introduce DeepMoveSORT, a novel, carefully engineered multi-object tracker designed specifically for such scenarios. In addition to standard methods of appearance-based association, we improve motion-based association by employing deep learnable filters (instead of the most commonly used Kalman filter) and a rich set of newly proposed heuristics. Our improvements to motion-based association methods are severalfold. First, we propose a new transformer-based filter architecture, TransFilter, which uses an object's motion history for both motion prediction and noise filtering. We further enhance the filter's performance by careful handling of its motion history and accounting for camera motion. Second, we propose a set of heuristics that exploit cues from the position, shape, and confidence of detected bounding boxes to improve association performance. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DeepMoveSORT outperforms existing trackers in scenarios featuring non-linear motion, surpassing state-of-the-art results on three such datasets. We also perform a thorough ablation study to evaluate the contributions of different tracker components which we proposed. Based on our study, we conclude that using a learnable filter instead of the Kalman filter, along with appearance-based association is key to achieving strong general tracking performance.

We propose a time efficient method called POPCat that exploits the multi-target and temporal features of video data to produce a semi-supervised pipeline for segmentation or box-based video annotation. The method retains the accuracy level associated with human level annotation while generating a large volume of semi-supervised annotations for greater generalization. The method capitalizes on temporal features through the use of a particle tracker to expand the domain of human-provided target points. This is done through the use of a particle tracker to reassociate the initial points to a set of images that follow the labeled frame. A YOLO model is then trained with this generated data, and then rapidly infers on the target video. Evaluations are conducted on GMOT-40, AnimalTrack, and Visdrone-2019 benchmarks. These multi-target video tracking/detection sets contain multiple similar-looking targets, camera movements, and other features that would commonly be seen in "wild" situations. We specifically choose these difficult datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the pipeline and for comparison purposes. The method applied on GMOT-40, AnimalTrack, and Visdrone shows a margin of improvement on recall/mAP50/mAP over the best results by a value of 24.5%/9.6%/4.8%, -/43.1%/27.8%, and 7.5%/9.4%/7.5% where metrics were collected.

This enables the segmentation and tracking of a diverse set of 3D semantic entities, specified using a simple and intuitive interface that includes a user click or a text prompt. To this end, we present DGD, a unified 3D representation for both the appearance and semantics of a dynamic 3D scene, building upon the recently proposed dynamic 3D Gaussians representation. Our representation is optimized over time with both color and semantic information.

To this end, we present a cost-effective solution to create lane-level roadmaps using only the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and a camera on customer vehicles. Our proposed solution utilizes a prior standard-definition (SD) map, GNSS measurements, visual odometry, and lane marking edge detection points, to simultaneously estimate the vehicle's 6D pose, its position within a SD map, and also the 3D geometry of traffic lines. This is achieved using a Bayesian simultaneous localization and multi-object tracking filter, where the estimation of traffic lines is formulated as a multiple extended object tracking problem, solved using a trajectory Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (TPMBM) filter. In TPMBM filtering, traffic lines are modeled using B-spline trajectories, and each trajectory is parameterized by a sequence of control points. The proposed solution has been evaluated using experimental data collected by a test vehicle driving on highway. Preliminary results show that the traffic line estimates, overlaid on the satellite image, generally align with the lane markings up to some lateral offsets.

This paper introduces a novel system that combines the Segment Anything model (SAM) -- a transformer-based visual foundation model -- with a robotic arm on a mobile platform. The design of integrating a depth camera on the robotic arm's end-effector ensures continuous object tracking, significantly mitigating environmental uncertainties. By deploying on a mobile platform, our grasping system has an enhanced mobility, playing a key role in dynamic environments where adaptability are critical. This synthesis enables dynamic object segmentation, tracking, and grasping. It also elevates user interaction, allowing the robot to intuitively respond to various modalities such as clicks, drawings, or voice commands, beyond traditional robotic systems. Empirical assessments in both simulated and real-world demonstrate the system's capabilities. This configuration opens avenues for wide-ranging applications, from industrial settings, agriculture, and household tasks, to specialized assignments and beyond.

However, there is an inherent difference between classification and regression tasks, so they have diverse even opposite demands for feature matching. Existed models always ignore the key issue and only employ a unified matching block in two task branches, decaying the decision quality. Besides, these models also struggle with decision misalignment situation. In this paper, we propose a multi-attention associate prediction network (MAPNet) to tackle the above problems. Concretely, two novel matchers, i.e., category-aware matcher and spatial-aware matcher, are first designed for feature comparison by integrating self, cross, channel or spatial attentions organically. They are capable of fully capturing the category-related semantics for classification and the local spatial contexts for regression, respectively. Then, we present a dual alignment module to enhance the correspondences between two branches, which is useful to find the optimal tracking solution. Finally, we describe a Siamese tracker built upon the proposed prediction network, which achieves the leading performance on five tracking benchmarks, consisting of LaSOT, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2k and UAV123, and surpasses other state-of-the-art approaches.

However, existing methods, which depend solely on appearance matching via Siamese networks or utilize motion information from successive frames, encounter significant challenges. Issues such as similar objects nearby or occlusions can result in tracker drift. To mitigate these challenges, we design an innovative spatio-temporal bi-directional cross-frame distractor filtering tracker, named STMD-Tracker. Our first step involves the creation of a 4D multi-frame spatio-temporal graph convolution backbone. This design separates KNN graph spatial embedding and incorporates 1D temporal convolution, effectively capturing temporal fluctuations and spatio-temporal information. Subsequently, we devise a novel bi-directional cross-frame memory procedure. This integrates future and synthetic past frame memory to enhance the current memory, thereby improving the accuracy of iteration-based tracking. This iterative memory update mechanism allows our tracker to dynamically compensate for information in the current frame, effectively reducing tracker drift. Lastly, we construct spatially reliable Gaussian masks on the fused features to eliminate distractor points. This is further supplemented by an object-aware sampling strategy, which bolsters the efficiency and precision of object localization, thereby reducing tracking errors caused by distractors. Our extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, there is still a lack of research on designing adversarial defense methods for object tracking. To address these issues, we propose an effective auxiliary pre-processing defense network, AADN, which performs defensive transformations on the input images before feeding them into the tracker. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with other visual trackers as a plug-and-play module without parameter adjustments. We train AADN using adversarial training, specifically employing Dua-Loss to generate adversarial samples that simultaneously attack the classification and regression branches of the tracker. Extensive experiments conducted on the OTB100, LaSOT, and VOT2018 benchmarks demonstrate that AADN maintains excellent defense robustness against adversarial attack methods in both adaptive and non-adaptive attack scenarios. Moreover, when transferring the defense network to heterogeneous trackers, it exhibits reliable transferability. Finally, AADN achieves a processing time of up to 5ms/frame, allowing seamless integration with existing high-speed trackers without introducing significant computational overhead.

The most probable track associations are identified by evaluating all possible track hypotheses across the temporal sliding window. A novel graph optimization approach is formulated to solve the multidimensional assignment problem with lifted graph edges introduced to account for missed detections and graph sparsity enforced to retain real-time efficiency. We evaluate our SWTrack implementation$^{2}$ on the NuScenes autonomous driving dataset to demonstrate improved tracking performance.

However, the KF requires domain-specific design choices and it is ill-suited to handling non-linear motion patterns. To address these limitations, we propose two innovative data-driven filtering methods. Our first method employs a Bayesian filter with a trainable motion model to predict an object's future location and combines its predictions with observations gained from an object detector to enhance bounding box prediction accuracy. Moreover, it dispenses with most domain-specific design choices characteristic of the KF. The second method, an end-to-end trainable filter, goes a step further by learning to correct detector errors, further minimizing the need for domain expertise. Additionally, we introduce a range of motion model architectures based on Recurrent Neural Networks, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, and Conditional Neural Processes, that are combined with the proposed filtering methods. Our extensive evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that our proposed filters outperform the traditional KF in object tracking, especially in the case of non-linear motion patterns -- the use case our filters are best suited to. We also conduct noise robustness analysis of our filters with convincing positive results. We further propose a new cost function for associating observations with tracks. Our tracker, which incorporates this new association cost with our proposed filters, outperforms the conventional SORT method and other motion-based trackers in multi-object tracking according to multiple metrics on motion-rich DanceTrack and SportsMOT datasets.

However, the extant literature exhibits a notable dearth in the exploration of this aspect. Deep learning methodologies encounter challenges in accurately discerning object motion states, while conventional approaches reliant on comprehensive mathematical modeling may yield suboptimal tracking accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce a Model-Data-Driven Motion State Judgment Object Tracking Method (MoD2T). This innovative architecture adeptly amalgamates traditional mathematical modeling with deep learning-based multi-object tracking frameworks. The integration of mathematical modeling and deep learning within MoD2T enhances the precision of object motion state determination, thereby elevating tracking accuracy. Our empirical investigations comprehensively validate the efficacy of MoD2T across varied scenarios, encompassing unmanned aerial vehicle surveillance and street-level tracking. Furthermore, to gauge the method's adeptness in discerning object motion states, we introduce the Motion State Validation F1 (MVF1) metric. This novel performance metric aims to quantitatively assess the accuracy of motion state classification, furnishing a comprehensive evaluation of MoD2T's performance. Elaborate experimental validations corroborate the rationality of MVF1. In order to holistically appraise MoD2T's performance, we meticulously annotate several renowned datasets and subject MoD2T to stringent testing. Remarkably, under conditions characterized by minimal or moderate camera motion, the achieved MVF1 values are particularly noteworthy, with exemplars including 0.774 for the KITTI dataset, 0.521 for MOT17, and 0.827 for UAVDT.

Prior work has shown that hybrid models -- combining neural networks and heuristics/algorithms -- can outperform vanilla deep learning for several computer vision tasks, such as classification or tracking. We consider the case of object tracking, and evaluate a hybrid model (PhyOT) that conceptualizes deep neural networks as ``sensors'' in a Kalman filter setup, where prior knowledge, in the form of Newtonian laws of motion, is used to fuse sensor observations and to perform improved estimations. Our experiments combine three neural networks, performing position, indirect velocity and acceleration estimation, respectively, and evaluate such a formulation on two benchmark datasets: a warehouse security camera dataset that we collected and annotated and a traffic camera open dataset. Results suggest that our PhyOT can track objects in extreme conditions that the state-of-the-art deep neural networks fail while its performance in general cases does not degrade significantly from that of existing deep learning approaches. Results also suggest that our PhyOT components are generalizable and transferable.

This survey offers a multifaceted view of deep-learning schemes for video instance segmentation, covering various architectural paradigms, along with comparisons of functional performance, model complexity, and computational overheads. In addition to the common architectural designs, auxiliary techniques for improving the performance of deep-learning models for video instance segmentation are compiled and discussed. Finally, we discuss a range of major challenges and directions for further investigations to help advance this promising research field.

We build our deep tracker upon a siamese network architecture, which is offline trained from scratch on multiple large-scale datasets in an end-to-end manner. The model contains a core component, that is, depthwise correlation and feature fusion module (correlation-fusion module), which facilitates model to learn a set of optimal weights for a specific object by utilizing ensembles of multi-level features from lower and higher layers and multi-channel semantics on the same layer. We combine the modified ResNet-50 with the proposed correlation-fusion layer to constitute the feature extractor of our model. In training process, we find the training of model become more stable, that benifits from the correlation-fusion module. For comprehensive evaluations of performance, we implement our tracker on the popular benchmarks, including OTB100, VOT2018 and LaSOT. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves favorably competitive performance against many leading trackers in terms of accuracy and precision, while satisfying the real-time requirements of applications.

Conventional methods either require pre-calibration or necessitate controlled environments. The state-of-the-art MoireTag approach exploits the Moire effect and QR-design to continuously track the angular shift precisely. However, it is still not a fully QR code design. To overcome the above challenges, we propose a novel snapshot method for discrete angular measurement and tracking with scannable QR-design patterns that are generated by binary structures printed on both sides of a glass plate. The QR codes, resulting from the parallax effect due to the geometry alignment between two layers, can be readily measured as angular information using a phone camera. The simulation results show that the proposed non-contact object tracking framework is computationally efficient with high accuracy.

In order to maximize the perception capabilities of the autonomous agent, we aim to develop a 3D MOT framework that fuses camera and LiDAR sensor information. Building on our prior LiDAR-only work, ShaSTA, which models shape and spatio-temporal affinities for 3D MOT, we propose a novel camera-LiDAR fusion approach for learning affinities. At its core, this work proposes a fusion technique that generates a rich sensory signal incorporating information about depth and distant objects to enhance affinity estimation for improved data association, track lifecycle management, false-positive elimination, false-negative propagation, and track confidence score refinement. Our main contributions include a novel fusion approach for combining camera and LiDAR sensory signals to learn affinities, and a first-of-its-kind multimodal sequential track confidence refinement technique that fuses 2D and 3D detections. Additionally, we perform an ablative analysis on each fusion step to demonstrate the added benefits of incorporating the camera sensor, particular for small, distant objects that tend to suffer from the depth-sensing limits and sparsity of LiDAR sensors. In sum, our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark amongst multimodal 3D MOT algorithms using CenterPoint detections.

Yet in practice, despite their theoretical advantages, the body of work on event-based multi-object tracking (MOT) remains in its infancy, especially in real-world settings where events from complex background and camera motion can easily obscure the true target motion. In this work, an event-based multi-object tracker, called SpikeMOT, is presented to address these challenges. SpikeMOT leverages spiking neural networks to extract sparse spatiotemporal features from event streams associated with objects. The resulting spike train representations are used to track the object movement at high frequency, while a simultaneous object detector provides updated spatial information of these objects at an equivalent frame rate. To evaluate the effectiveness of SpikeMOT, we introduce DSEC-MOT, the first large-scale event-based MOT benchmark incorporating fine-grained annotations for objects experiencing severe occlusions, frequent trajectory intersections, and long-term re-identification in real-world contexts. Extensive experiments employing DSEC-MOT and another event-based dataset, named FE240hz, demonstrate SpikeMOT's capability to achieve high tracking accuracy amidst challenging real-world scenarios, advancing the state-of-the-art in event-based multi-object tracking.

In this paper, we extensively investigate the robustness of existing RGBD-based 6DoF pose estimation methods against varying levels of depth sensor noise. We highlight that existing 6DoF pose estimation methods suffer significant performance discrepancies due to depth measurement inaccuracies. In response to the robustness issue, we present a simple and effective transformer-based 6DoF pose estimation approach called DTTDNet, featuring a novel geometric feature filtering module and a Chamfer distance loss for training. Moreover, we advance the field of robust 6DoF pose estimation and introduce a new dataset -- Digital Twin Tracking Dataset Mobile (DTTD-Mobile), tailored for digital twin object tracking with noisy depth data from the mobile RGBD sensor suite of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTTDNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods at least 4.32, up to 60.74 points in ADD metrics on the DTTD-Mobile. More importantly, our approach exhibits superior robustness to varying levels of measurement noise, setting a new benchmark for robustness to measurement noise.

During the visit of active asteroid Bennu, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft relied on the analysis of images captured by onboard navigation cameras to detect particle ejection events, which ultimately became one of the mission's scientific highlights. To increase the scientific return of similar time-constrained missions, this work proposes an event-based solution that is dedicated to the detection and tracking of centimetre-sized particles. Unlike a standard frame-based camera, the pixels of an event-based camera independently trigger events indicating whether the scene brightness has increased or decreased at that time and location in the sensor plane. As a result of the sparse and asynchronous spatiotemporal output, event cameras combine very high dynamic range and temporal resolution with low-power consumption, which could complement existing onboard imaging techniques. This paper motivates the use of a scientific event camera by reconstructing the particle ejection episodes reported by the OSIRIS-REx mission in a photorealistic scene generator and in turn, simulating event-based observations. The resulting streams of spatiotemporal data support future work on event-based multi-object tracking.

Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), which inevitably suffers from mutual object interference, occlusion, etc., is even more difficult without label supervision. In this paper, we explore the latent consistency of sample features across video frames and propose an Unsupervised Contrastive Similarity Learning method, named UCSL, including three contrast modules: self-contrast, cross-contrast, and ambiguity contrast. Specifically, i) self-contrast uses intra-frame direct and inter-frame indirect contrast to obtain discriminative representations by maximizing self-similarity. ii) Cross-contrast aligns cross- and continuous-frame matching results, mitigating the persistent negative effect caused by object occlusion. And iii) ambiguity contrast matches ambiguous objects with each other to further increase the certainty of subsequent object association through an implicit manner. On existing benchmarks, our method outperforms the existing unsupervised methods using only limited help from ReID head, and even provides higher accuracy than lots of fully supervised methods.

This paper develops a real-time multi-object tracking and prediction system in rugged environments. A 3D object detection algorithm based on Lidar-camera fusion is designed to detect the target objects. Based on the Hungarian algorithm, this paper designs a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm with an adaptive threshold to realize the stable matching and tracking of the objects. We combine Memory Augmented Neural Networks (MANN) and Kalman filter to achieve 3D trajectory prediction on rugged terrains. Besides, we realize a new dynamic SLAM by using the results of multi-object tracking to remove dynamic points for better SLAM performance and static map. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-object tracking and prediction system, several simulations and physical experiments are conducted. The results show that the proposed system can track dynamic objects and provide future trajectory and a more clean static map in real-time.

One of the key aspects of seed phenotyping is cereal yield estimation that the seed production industry relies upon to conduct their business. While mechanized seed kernel counters are available in the market currently, they are often priced high and sometimes outside the range of small scale seed production firms' affordability. The development of object tracking neural network models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) enables computer scientists to design algorithms that can estimate cereal yield inexpensively. The key bottleneck with neural network models is that they require a plethora of labelled training data before they can be put to task. We demonstrate that the use of synthetic imagery serves as a feasible substitute to train neural networks for object tracking that includes the tasks of object classification and detection. Furthermore, we propose a seed kernel counter that uses a low-cost mechanical hopper, trained YOLOv8 neural network model, and object tracking algorithms on StrongSORT and ByteTrack to estimate cereal yield from videos. The experiment yields a seed kernel count with an accuracy of 95.2\% and 93.2\% for Soy and Wheat respectively using the StrongSORT algorithm, and an accuray of 96.8\% and 92.4\% for Soy and Wheat respectively using the ByteTrack algorithm.

We leverage two off-the-shelf cameras, one on the top of the court and the other on the side of the court. The one on the top is to track players' trajectories, while the one on the side is to analyze the pixel features of players. By computing the correlations between adjacent frames and engaging the information of the two cameras, MOT of badminton players is obtained. This two-camera approach addresses the challenge of player occlusion and overlapping in a badminton court, providing player trajectory tracking and multi-angle analysis. The presented system offers insights into the positions and movements of badminton players, thus serving as a coaching or self-training tool for badminton players to improve their gaming strategies.

In this context, competitive models are presented every year, showing a constant growth rate in performances, mainly measured in standardized protocols as Visual Object Tracking (VOT) and Object Tracking Benchmark (OTB). Fusion-trackers strategy has been applied over last few years for overcoming the known re-detection problem, turning out to be an important breakthrough. Following this approach, this work aims to generalize the fusion concept to an arbitrary number of trackers used as baseline trackers in the pipeline, leveraging a learning phase to better understand how outcomes correlate with each other, even when no target is present. A model and data independence conjecture will be evidenced in the manuscript, yielding a recall of 0.738 on LTB-50 dataset when learning from VOT-LT2022, and 0.619 by reversing the two datasets. In both cases, results are strongly competitive with state-of-the-art and recall turns out to be the first on the podium.

The development of deep learning, which has encouraged researchers to propose more and more work in this direction, has significantly impacted the scientific advancement around the study of tracking as well as many other domains related to computer vision. In fact, all of the solutions that are currently state-of-the-art in the literature and in the tracking industry, are built on top of deep learning methodologies that produce exceptionally good results. Deep learning is enabled thanks to the ever more powerful technology researchers can use to handle the significant computational resources demanded by these models. However, when real-time is a main requirement, developing a tracking system without being constrained by expensive hardware support with enormous computational resources is necessary to widen tracking applications in real-world contexts. To this end, a compromise is to combine powerful deep strategies with more traditional approaches to favor considerably lower processing solutions at the cost of less accurate tracking results even though suitable for real-time domains. Indeed, the present work goes in that direction, proposing a hybrid strategy for real-time multi-target tracking that combines effectively a classical optical flow algorithm with a deep learning architecture, targeted to a human-crowd tracking system exhibiting a desirable trade-off between performance in tracking precision and computational costs. The developed architecture was experimented with different settings, and yielded a MOTA of 0.608 out of the compared state-of-the-art 0.549 results, and about half the running time when introducing the optical flow phase, achieving almost the same performance in terms of accuracy.

However, RGB images captured by cameras lack depth information, which poses a significant challenge in 3D detection tasks. To supplement this missing data, mapping sensors such as LIDAR and RADAR are used for accurate 3D Object Detection. Despite their significant accuracy, the multi-sensor models are expensive and require a high computational demand. In contrast, Monocular 3D Object Detection models are becoming increasingly popular, offering a faster, cheaper, and easier-to-implement solution for 3D detections. This paper introduces a different Multi-Tasking Learning approach called MonoNext that utilizes a spatial grid to map objects in the scene. MonoNext employs a straightforward approach based on the ConvNext network and requires only 3D bounding box annotated data. In our experiments with the KITTI dataset, MonoNext achieved high precision and competitive performance comparable with state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by adding more training data, MonoNext surpassed itself and achieved higher accuracies.

While exploiting temporal priors eases this problem, object-specific knowledge is required to recover when tracking is lost. Under the tight time constraints of the tracking task, RGB(D)-based methods are often conceptionally complex or rely on heuristic motion models. In comparison, we propose to simplify object tracking to a reinforced point cloud (depth only) alignment task. This allows us to train a streamlined approach from scratch with limited amounts of sparse 3D point clouds, compared to the large datasets of diverse RGBD sequences required in previous works. We incorporate temporal frame-to-frame registration with object-based recovery by frame-to-model refinement using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that jointly solves for both objectives. We also show that the RL agent's uncertainty and a rendering-based mask propagation are effective reinitialization triggers.

In the labeled random finite sets literature, Gibbs sampling procedures have recently been applied to efficiently truncate the single-sensor and multi-sensor $Î´$-generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli posterior density as well as the multi-sensor adaptive labeled multi-Bernoulli birth distribution. However, only a limited discussion has been provided regarding key Gibbs sampler architecture details including the Markov chain Monte Carlo sample generation technique and early termination criteria. This paper begins with a brief background on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and a review of the Gibbs sampler implementations proposed for labeled random finite sets filters. Next, we propose a short chain, multi-simulation sample generation technique that is well suited for these applications and enables a parallel processing implementation. Additionally, we present two heuristic early termination criteria that achieve similar sampling performance with substantially fewer Markov chain observations. Finally, the benefits of the proposed Gibbs samplers are demonstrated via two Monte Carlo simulations.

Current methods rely on nearest-neighbour (NN) matching, where the query feature space is converted to NN space by representing each query pixel with its NN in the template. NN-based methods have been shown to perform better in occlusions, appearance changes, and non-rigid transformations; however, they scale poorly with high-resolution data and high feature dimensions. We present an NN-based method which efficiently reduces the NN computations and introduces filtering in the NN fields (NNFs). A vector quantization step is introduced before the NN calculation to represent the template with $k$ features, and the filter response over the NNFs is used to compare the template and query distributions over the features. We show that state-of-the-art performance is achieved in low-resolution data, and our method outperforms previous methods at higher resolution.

We aim at re-popularizing this approach and propose: 1. a framework for accurate instance segmentation of linear objects in document images using Multiple Object Tracking (MOT); 2. document image datasets and metrics which enable both vector- and pixel-based evaluation of linear object detection; 3. performance measures of MOT approaches against modern segment detectors; 4. performance measures of various tracking strategies, exhibiting alternatives to the original Kalman filters approach; and 5. an open-source implementation of a detector which can discriminate instances of curved, erased, dashed, intersecting and/or overlapping linear objects.

First, we use the ImageNet dataset as an auxiliary to randomize the style of synthetic data. With out-of-domain data, we further enforce pyramid consistency loss across different "stylized" images from the same sample to learn domain invariant features. Second, we adopt the pseudo-labeling method to effectively utilize the unlabeled MOT17 training data. To obtain high-quality pseudo-labels, we apply proximal policy optimization (PPO2) algorithm to search confidence thresholds for each sequence. When using the unlabeled MOT17 training set, combined with the pure-motion tracking strategy upgraded via developed post-processing, we finally reach 61.4 HOTA.

Over the last two decades, numerous researchers have proposed various algorithms to solve this problem and achieved promising results. Recently, Transformer-based tracking approaches have ushered in a new era in single-object tracking by introducing new perspectives and achieving superior tracking robustness. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth literature analysis of Transformer tracking approaches by categorizing them into CNN-Transformer based trackers, Two-stream Two-stage fully-Transformer based trackers, and One-stream One-stage fully-Transformer based trackers. In addition, we conduct experimental evaluations to assess their tracking robustness and computational efficiency using publicly available benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we measure their performances on different tracking scenarios to identify their strengths and weaknesses in particular situations. Our survey provides insights into the underlying principles of Transformer tracking approaches, the challenges they encounter, and the future directions they may take.

The trained module assigns zero weights to incorrect correspondences (outliers) in most cases, making the method robust and eliminating the need of the typically used non-differentiable robust estimators like RANSAC.

Firstly, a ConvLSTM-PAN model structure is designed to capture suspicious flying bird objects, in which the Convolutional Long and Short Time Memory (ConvLSTM) network aggregated the Spatio-temporal features of the flying bird object on adjacent multi-frame before the input of the model and the Path Aggregation Network (PAN) located the suspicious flying bird objects. Then, an object tracking algorithm is used to track suspicious flying bird objects and calculate their Motion Range (MR). At the same time, the size of the MR of the suspicious flying bird object is adjusted adaptively according to its speed of movement (specifically, if the bird moves slowly, its MR will be expanded according to the speed of the bird to ensure the environmental information needed to detect the flying bird object). Adaptive Spatio-temporal Cubes (ASt-Cubes) of the flying bird objects are generated to ensure that the SNR of the flying bird objects is improved, and the necessary environmental information is retained adaptively. Finally, a LightWeight U-Shape Net (LW-USN) based on ASt-Cubes is designed to detect flying bird objects, which rejects the false detections of the suspicious flying bird objects and returns the position of the real flying bird objects. The monitoring video including the flying birds is collected in the unattended traction substation as the experimental dataset to verify the performance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the flying bird object detection method based on motion information proposed in this paper can effectively detect the flying bird object in surveillance video.

We propose a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique to provide the model information about instance segmentation uncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by employing a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based, rotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label generation method provides multiple geometrically-transformed images as inputs to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections generated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them using the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a single-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the targets. Our method also incorporates a multi-view trajectory association mechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel across camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association performances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic airport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection accuracy by up to $42\%$ without increasing the inference time of the model. Our multi-camera association method achieves up to $89\%$ multi-object tracking accuracy with an average computation time of less than $15$ ms.

The quality of tracking is largely dependent on the quality of the detector used. In many applications, such as autonomous vehicles, it is preferable to over-detect objects to avoid catastrophic outcomes due to missed detections. As a result, current state-of-the-art 3D detectors produce high rates of false-positives to ensure a low number of false-negatives. This can negatively affect tracking by making data association and track lifecycle management more challenging. Additionally, occasional false-negative detections due to difficult scenarios like occlusions can harm tracking performance. To address these issues in a unified framework, we propose to learn shape and spatio-temporal affinities between tracks and detections in consecutive frames. Our affinity provides a probabilistic matching that leads to robust data association, track lifecycle management, false-positive elimination, false-negative propagation, and sequential track confidence refinement. Though past 3D MOT approaches address a subset of components in this problem domain, we offer the first self-contained framework that addresses all these aspects of the 3D MOT problem. We quantitatively evaluate our method on the nuScenes tracking benchmark where we achieve 1st place amongst LiDAR-only trackers using CenterPoint detections. Our method estimates accurate and precise tracks, while decreasing the overall number of false-positive and false-negative tracks and increasing the number of true-positive tracks. We analyze our performance with 5 metrics, giving a comprehensive overview of our approach to indicate how our tracking framework may impact the ultimate goal of an autonomous mobile agent. We also present ablative experiments and qualitative results that demonstrate our framework's capabilities in complex scenarios.

Imprecise and Negative Information in Gaussian Mixture Random Finite Set Filtering</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>In object tracking and state estimation problems, ambiguous evidence such as imprecise measurements and the absence of detections can contain valuable information and thus be leveraged to further refine the probabilistic belief state. In particular, knowledge of a sensor's bounded field-of-view can be exploited to incorporate evidence of where an object was not observed. This paper presents a systematic approach for incorporating knowledge of the field-of-view geometry and position and object inclusion/exclusion evidence into object state densities and random finite set multi-object cardinality distributions. The resulting state estimation problem is nonlinear and solved using a new Gaussian mixture approximation based on recursive component splitting. Based on this approximation, a novel Gaussian mixture Bernoulli filter for imprecise measurements is derived and demonstrated in a tracking problem using only natural language statements as inputs. This paper also considers the relationship between bounded fields-of-view and cardinality distributions for a representative selection of multi-object distributions, which can be used for sensor planning, as is demonstrated through a problem involving a multi-Bernoulli process with up to one-hundred potential objects.

Instance segmentation is a high-precision method in computer vision for detecting individual animals of interest. This method can be used for in-depth analysis of animals, such as examining their subtle interactive behaviors, from videos and images. However, existing deep-learning-based instance segmentation methods have been mostly developed based on public datasets, which largely omit heavy occlusion problems; therefore, these methods have limitations in real-world applications involving object occlusions, such as farrowing pen systems used on pig farms in which the farrowing crates often impede the sow and piglets. In this paper, we adapt a Center Clustering Network originally designed for counting to achieve instance segmentation, dubbed as CClusnet-Inseg. Specifically, CClusnet-Inseg uses each pixel to predict object centers and trace these centers to form masks based on clustering results, which consists of a network for segmentation and center offset vector map, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, Centers-to-Mask (C2M), and Remain-Centers-to-Mask (RC2M) algorithms. In all, 4,600 images were extracted from six videos collected from three closed and three half-open farrowing crates to train and validate our method. CClusnet-Inseg achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 84.1 and outperforms all other methods compared in this study. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of core modules of our method. In addition, we apply CClusnet-Inseg to multi-object tracking for animal monitoring, and the predicted object center that is a conjunct output could serve as an occlusion-resistant representation of the location of an object.

During the tracking process, the system assigns an identifier or label to each tracked object to distinguish it from other objects. In such a mission, it is essential to keep this identifier for the same objects, whatever the area, the time of their appearance, or the detecting camera. This is to conserve as much information about the tracking object as possible, decrease the number of ID switching (ID-Sw), and increase the quality of object tracking. To accomplish object labeling, a massive amount of data collected by the cameras must be searched to retrieve the most similar (nearest neighbor) object identifier. Although this task is simple, it becomes very complex in large-scale video surveillance networks, where the data becomes very large. In this case, the label retrieval time increases significantly with this increase, which negatively affects the performance of the real-time tracking system. To avoid such problems, we propose a new solution to automatically label multiple objects for efficient real-time tracking using the indexing mechanism. This mechanism organizes the metadata of the objects extracted during the detection and tracking phase in an Adaptive BCCF-tree. The main advantage of this structure is: its ability to index massive metadata generated by multi-cameras, its logarithmic search complexity, which implicitly reduces the search response time, and its quality of research results, which ensure coherent labeling of the tracked objects. The system load is distributed through a new Internet of Video Things infrastructure-based architecture to improve data processing and real-time object tracking performance. The experimental evaluation was conducted on a publicly available dataset generated by multi-camera containing different crowd activities.

This paper proposes a novel multi-object dynamic lidar odometry (MLO) based on semantic object detection technology to solve this problem. The MLO system can provide reliable localization of robot and semantic objects and build long-term static maps in complex dynamic scenes. For ego-motion estimation, we use the environment features that take semantic and geometric consistency constraints into account in the extraction process. The filtering features are robust to semantic movable and unknown dynamic objects. At the same time, a least square estimator using the semantic bounding box and object point cloud is proposed to achieve accurate and stable multi-object tracking between frames. In the mapping module, we further realize dynamic semantic object detection based on the absolute trajectory tracking list (ATTL). Then, static semantic objects and environmental features can be used to eliminate accumulated localization errors and build pure static maps. Experiments on public KITTI data sets show that the proposed system can achieve more accurate and robust tracking of the object and better real-time localization accuracy in complex scenes compared with existing technologies.

This is a very challenging problem due to (i) the lack of distinguishing visual features for each mouse, and (ii) the close confines of the scene with constant occlusion, making standard visual tracking approaches unusable. However, a coarse estimate of each mouse's location is available from a unique RFID implant, so there is the potential to optimally combine information from (weak) tracking with coarse information on identity. To achieve our objective, we make the following key contributions: (a) the formulation of the object identification problem as an assignment problem (solved using Integer Linear Programming), and (b) a novel probabilistic model of the affinity between tracklets and RFID data. The latter is a crucial part of the model, as it provides a principled probabilistic treatment of object detections given coarse localisation. Our approach achieves 77% accuracy on this animal identification problem, and is able to reject spurious detections when the animals are hidden.

In object tracking applications, sensor actions are chosen based on the expected reduction in uncertainty also known as information gain. Random finite set (RFS) theory provides a formalism for quantifying and estimating information gain in multi-object tracking problems. However, estimating information gain in these applications remains computationally challenging. This paper presents a new tractable approximation of the RFS expected information gain applicable to sensor control for multi-object search and tracking. Unlike existing RFS approaches, the information gain approximation presented in this paper considers the contributions of non-ideal noisy measurements, missed detections, false alarms, and object appearance/disappearance. The effectiveness of the information-driven sensor control is demonstrated through two multi-vehicle search-while-tracking experiments using real video data from remote terrestrial and satellite sensors.

With a robust and accurate tracking system on surgical videos, the motion dynamics and movement patterns of the hands can be captured and analyzed for many rich tasks. In this work, we propose a novel hand pose estimation model, CondPose, which improves detection and tracking accuracy by incorporating a pose prior into its prediction. We show improvements over state-of-the-art methods which provide frame-wise independent predictions, by following a temporally guided approach that effectively leverages past predictions. We collect Surgical Hands, the first dataset that provides multi-instance articulated hand pose annotations for videos. Our dataset provides over 8.1k annotated hand poses from publicly available surgical videos and bounding boxes, pose annotations, and tracking IDs to enable multi-instance tracking. When evaluated on Surgical Hands, we show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach using mean Average Precision (mAP), to measure pose estimation accuracy, and Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), to assess pose tracking performance. In comparison to a frame-wise independent strategy, we show greater performance in detecting and tracking hand poses and more substantial impact on localization accuracy. This has positive implications in generating more accurate representations of hands in the scene to be used for targeted downstream tasks.

However, in complex scenes, the apparent characteristics of the tracked target are variable, which makes it easy to pollute the model and cause the model drift. In this paper, considering that the secondary peak has a greater impact on the model update, we propose a method for detecting the primary and secondary peaks of the response map. Secondly, a novel confidence function which uses the adaptive update discriminant mechanism is proposed, which yield good robustness. Thirdly, we propose a robust tracker with correlation filters, which uses hand-crafted features and can improve model drift in complex scenes. Finally, in order to cope with the current trackers' multi-feature response merge, we propose a simple exponential adaptive merge approach. Extensive experiments are performed on OTB2013, OTB100 and TC128 datasets. Our approach performs superiorly against several state-of-the-art trackers while runs at speed in real time.

Starting with the original definition of the Mahalanobis distance we review its use in association. Given that there is no principle in multi-object tracking that sets the Mahalanobis distance apart as a distinguished statistical distance we revisit the global association hypotheses of multiple hypothesis tracking as the most general association setting. Those association hypotheses induce a distance-like quantity for assignment which we refer to as association log-likelihood distance. We compare the ability of the Mahalanobis distance to the association log-likelihood distance to yield correct association relations in Monte-Carlo simulations. It turns out that on average the distance based on association log-likelihood performs better than the Mahalanobis distance, confirming that the maximization of global association hypotheses is a more fundamental approach to association than the minimization of a certain statistical distance measure.

This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Despite doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles, previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences based on the learned embeddings.

However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.

Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter (MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU (Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of 67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory. Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology (IST)Scientific and Technical Committee, IST-209-RSY - the ICMCIS, held in Oeiras, Portugal, 13-14 May 2025.

This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities. And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces effective feature representations that support more accurate target localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed. Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second. This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

In this paper, we employed a background subtraction-based scheme to detect the temporarily stationary objects. We proposed two schemes for stationary object detection, and we compare those in terms of detection performance and computational complexity. In the first approach, we used a single background, and in the second approach, we used dual backgrounds, generated with different learning rates, in order to detect temporarily stopped objects. Finally, we used normalized cross correlation (NCC) based image comparison to monitor and track the detected stationary object in a video scene. The proposed method is robust with partial occlusion, short-time fully occlusion, and illumination changes, and it can operate in real time.

To address this bottleneck, we introduce SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives, our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments, making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.

Effective matching mitigates perception errors, enhancing object identification and tracking for improved performance and safety. However, traditional metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Center Point Distances (CPDs), which are effective in 2D image planes, often fail to find critical matches in complex 3D scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce Contour Errors (CEs), an ego or object-centric metric for identifying matches of interest in tracking scenarios from a functional perspective. By comparing bounding boxes in the ego vehicle's frame, contour errors provide a more functionally relevant assessment of object matches. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that contour errors improve the reliability of matches over the state-of-the-art 2D IoU and CPD metrics in tracking-by-detection methods. In 3D car tracking, our results show that Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges and 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.

To address this, we propose a framework to enhance tiny head detection and tracking by optimizing the balance between performance and efficiency. Our framework integrates (1) a cross-domain detection loss, (2) a multi-scale module, and (3) a small receptive field detection mechanism. These innovations enhance detection by bridging the gap between large and small detectors, capturing high-frequency details at multiple scales during training, and using filters with small receptive fields to detect tiny heads. Evaluations on the CroHD and CrowdHuman datasets show improved Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and mean Average Precision (mAP), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in crowded scenes.

Traditional tracking systems often rely on hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.724 and an aMOTP of 0.475, while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP.

Nevertheless, existing BGS techniques utilizing deep learning still encounter challenges with various background noises in videos, including variations in lighting, shifts in camera angles, and disturbances like air turbulence or swaying trees. To address this problem, we design a spiking autoencoder network, termed SAEN-BGS, based on noise resilience and time-sequence sensitivity of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance the separation of foreground and background. To eliminate unnecessary background noise and preserve the important foreground elements, we begin by creating the continuous spiking conv-and-dconv block, which serves as the fundamental building block for the decoder in SAEN-BGS. Moreover, in striving for enhanced energy efficiency, we introduce a novel self-distillation spiking supervised learning method grounded in ANN-to-SNN frameworks, resulting in decreased power consumption. In extensive experiments conducted on CDnet-2014 and DAVIS-2016 datasets, our approach demonstrates superior segmentation performance relative to other baseline methods, even when challenged by complex scenarios with dynamic backgrounds.

However, manual object tracking and matching across multiple non-overlapping cameras pose significant challenges in city-scale urban traffic scenarios. These challenges include handling diverse vehicle attributes, occlusions, illumination variations, shadows, and varying video resolutions. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object Multi-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT). The proposed framework utilizes Mask R-CNN for object detection and employs Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select target objects from overlapping detections. Transfer learning is employed for re-identification, enabling the association and generation of vehicle tracklets across multiple cameras. Moreover, we leverage appropriate loss functions and distance measures to handle occlusion, illumination, and shadow challenges. The final solution identification module performs feature extraction using ResNet-152 coupled with Deep SORT based vehicle tracking. The proposed framework is evaluated on the 5th AI City Challenge dataset (Track 3), comprising 46 camera feeds. Among these 46 camera streams, 40 are used for model training and validation, while the remaining six are utilized for model testing. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance with an IDF1 score of 0.8289, and precision and recall scores of 0.9026 and 0.8527 respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in robust and accurate vehicle tracking.

While non-invasive video monitoring has become a common practice in finfish aquaculture, existing intelligent monitoring methods predominantly focus on assessing body condition or fish swimming patterns and are often developed and evaluated in controlled tank environments, without demonstrating their applicability to real-world aquaculture settings in open sea farms. This underscores the necessity for methods that can monitor physiological traits directly within the production environment of sea fish farms. To this end, we have developed a computer vision method for monitoring ventilation rates of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which was specifically designed for videos recorded in the production environment of commercial sea fish farms using the existing infrastructure. Our approach uses a fish head detection model, which classifies the mouth state as either open or closed using a convolutional neural network. This is followed with multiple object tracking to create temporal sequences of fish swimming across the field of view of the underwater video camera to estimate ventilation rates. The method demonstrated high efficiency, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.82 between ground truth and predicted ventilation rates in a test set of 100 fish collected independently of the training data. By accurately identifying pens where fish exhibit signs of respiratory distress, our method offers broad applicability and the potential to transform fish health and welfare monitoring in finfish aquaculture.

These consecutive frame images enable the algorithm to update the position and state of the target in real-time in each frame of the image. How to accurately associate the detected target with the target in the previous or next frame to form a stable trajectory is a complex problem. Therefore, a multi object tracking and detection method for intelligent driving vehicles based on YOLOv5 and point cloud 3D projection is proposed. Using Retinex algorithm to enhance the image of the environment in front of the vehicle, remove light interference in the image, and build an intelligent detection model based on YOLOv5 network structure. The enhanced image is input into the model, and multiple targets in front of the vehicle are identified through feature extraction and target localization. By combining point cloud 3D projection technology, the correlation between the position changes of adjacent frame images in the projection coordinate system can be inferred. By sequentially projecting the multi-target recognition results of multiple consecutive frame images into the 3D laser point cloud environment, effective tracking of the motion trajectories of all targets in front of the vehicle can be achieved. The experimental results show that the application of this method for intelligent driving vehicle front multi-target tracking and detection yields a MOTA (Tracking Accuracy) value greater than 30, demonstrating its superior tracking and detection performance.

Importantly, all three networks are designed to be run in a realtime, embedded environment. Each network contains less than 50k trainable parameters. Our evaluation, conducted on the public KITTI tracking dataset, demonstrates significant improvements in tracking performance. SPENT reduces the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 50% compared to a standard KF, while SANT and MANTa achieve up to 95% accuracy in sensor object-to-track assignments. These results underscore the effectiveness of incorporating task-specific NNs into traditional tracking systems, boosting performance and robustness while preserving modularity, maintainability, and interpretability.

Traditional optical flow estimation methods rely on restrictive assumptions like brightness constancy and slow motion constraints. Recent deep learning-based flow estimations require extensive training on large domain-specific datasets, making them computationally demanding. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) advances have enabled deep learning models to take advantage of optical flow as an important feature for object tracking and motion analysis. Since optical flow is commonly encoded in HSV for visualization, its conversion to RGB for neural network processing is nonlinear and may introduce perceptual distortions. These transformations amplify the sensitivity to estimation errors, potentially affecting the predictive accuracy of the networks. To address these challenges that are influential to the performance of downstream network models, we propose Reynolds flow, a novel training-free flow estimation inspired by the Reynolds transport theorem, offering a principled approach to modeling complex motion dynamics. In addition to conventional HSV-based visualization of Reynolds flow, we also introduce an RGB-encoded representation of Reynolds flow designed to improve flow visualization and feature enhancement for neural networks. We evaluated the effectiveness of Reynolds flow in video-based tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks, tiny object detection on UAVDB, infrared object detection on Anti-UAV, and pose estimation on GolfDB, demonstrate that networks trained with RGB-encoded Reynolds flow achieve SOTA performance, exhibiting improved robustness and efficiency across all tasks.

Conventional lightweight trackers often struggle with robustness under occlusion and interference, while deep trackers, when compressed to meet resource constraints, suffer from performance degradation. To address these issues, we introduce CFTrack, a lightweight tracker that integrates contrastive learning and feature matching to enhance discriminative feature representations. CFTrack dynamically assesses target similarity during prediction through a novel contrastive feature matching module optimized with an adaptive contrastive loss, thereby improving tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on LaSOT, OTB100, and UAV123 show that CFTrack surpasses many state-of-the-art lightweight trackers, operating at 136 frames per second on the NVIDIA Jetson NX platform. Results on the HOOT dataset further demonstrate CFTrack's strong discriminative ability under heavy occlusion.

This field faces significant challenges such as occlusions and complex environmental dynamics, impacting model accuracy and efficiency. While traditional approaches have relied on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), introducing transformers has brought substantial advancements. This work introduces OneTrack-M, a transformer-based MOT model designed to enhance tracking computational efficiency and accuracy. Our approach simplifies the typical transformer-based architecture by eliminating the need for a decoder model for object detection and tracking. Instead, the encoder alone serves as the backbone for temporal data interpretation, significantly reducing processing time and increasing inference speed. Additionally, we employ innovative data pre-processing and multitask training techniques to address occlusion and diverse objective challenges within a single set of weights. Experimental results demonstrate that OneTrack-M achieves at least 25% faster inference times compared to state-of-the-art models in the literature while maintaining or improving tracking accuracy metrics. These improvements highlight the potential of the proposed solution for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotics, where rapid responses are crucial for system effectiveness.

While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.

Existing approaches to dynamic object detection often rely on pretrained learned networks or computationally expensive volumetric maps. To enhance efficiency on computationally limited robots, we reuse data between the odometry and detection module. Utilizing a range image segmentation technique and a novel residual-based heuristic, our method distinguishes dynamic from static objects before integrating them into the point cloud map. The approach demonstrates robust object tracking and improved map accuracy in environments with numerous dynamic objects. Even highly non-rigid objects, such as running humans, are accurately detected at point level without prior downsampling of the point cloud and hence, without loss of information. Evaluation on simulated and real-world data validates its computational efficiency. Compared to a state-of-the-art volumetric method, our approach shows comparable detection performance at a fraction of the processing time, adding only 14 ms to the odometry module for dynamic object detection and tracking. The implementation and a new real-world dataset are available as open-source for further research.

In this study, we enhance the training dataset through data fusion, enabling simultaneous detection of vehicles and pedestrians. Image preprocessing and augmentation are subsequently performed to improve the quality and quantity of the dataset. Transfer learning is applied on the YOLOv8 pretrained model to increase the model's capability to identify a diverse array of vehicles. Optimal hyperparameters are obtained using the Grid Search algorithm, with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer outperforming other optimizers under these settings. Extensive experimentation and evaluation demonstrate substantial accuracy within the detection framework, with the model achieving 0.794 mAP@0.5 on the validation set and 0.786 mAP@0.5 on the test set, surpassing previous benchmarks on similar datasets. The DeepSORT multi-object tracking algorithm is incorporated to track detected vehicles and pedestrians in this study. Finally, the framework is tested to measure heterogeneous traffic states in mixed traffic conditions. Two locations with differing traffic compositions and congestion levels are selected: one motorized-dominant location with moderate density and one non-motorized-dominant location with higher density. Errors are statistically insignificant for both cases, showing correlations from 0.99 to 0.88 and 0.91 to 0.97 for heterogeneous traffic flow and speed measurements, respectively.

It plays a critical role in various UAV applications, including traffic monitoring systems and real-time suspect tracking by the police. However, this task is highly challenging due to the fast motion of UAVs, as well as the small size of target objects in the videos caused by the high-altitude and wide angle views of drones. In this study, we thus introduce a simple yet more effective method compared to previous work to overcome these challenges. Our approach involves a new tracking strategy, which initiates the tracking of target objects from low-confidence detections commonly encountered in UAV application scenarios. Additionally, we propose revisiting traditional appearance-based matching algorithms to improve the association of low-confidence detections. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted benchmark evaluations on two UAV-specific datasets (VisDrone2019, UAVDT) and one general object tracking dataset (MOT17). The results demonstrate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the art methodologies, highlighting its robustness and adaptability in diverse tracking environments. Furthermore, we have improved the annotation of the UAVDT dataset by rectifying several errors and addressing omissions found in the original annotations.

In applications such as pedestrian tracking, where sensitive personal data is involved, the potential for privacy violations and data misuse becomes a significant issue if data is transmitted to external servers. To mitigate these risks, processing data directly on an edge device, such as a smart camera, has emerged as a viable solution. Edge computing ensures that sensitive information remains local, thereby aligning with stringent privacy principles and significantly reducing network latency. However, the implementation of MOT on edge devices is not without its challenges. Edge devices typically possess limited computational resources, necessitating the development of highly optimized algorithms capable of delivering real-time performance under these constraints. The disparity between the computational requirements of state-of-the-art MOT algorithms and the capabilities of edge devices emphasizes a significant obstacle. To address these challenges, we propose a neural network pruning method specifically tailored to compress complex networks, such as those used in modern MOT systems. This approach optimizes MOT performance by ensuring high accuracy and efficiency within the constraints of limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA's Jetson Orin Nano. By applying our pruning method, we achieve model size reductions of up to 70% while maintaining a high level of accuracy and further improving performance on the Jetson Orin Nano, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for edge computing applications.

In addition, it gives the depth of each object, enabling pseudo-3D MOT. We evaluated its performance by adding it to various 2D MOT methods on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets and confirmed its effectiveness. Applying CAMOT to ByteTrack, we obtained 63.8% HOTA, 80.6% MOTA, and 78.5% IDF1 in MOT17, which are state-of-the-art results.

This has led to a growing interest in analyzing and extracting insights from these meetings, which requires effective detection and tracking of unique individuals. In practice, there is no standardization in video meetings recording layout, and how they are captured across the different platforms and services. This, in turn, creates a challenge in acquiring this data stream and analyzing it in a uniform fashion. Our approach provides a solution to the most general form of video recording, usually consisting of a grid of participants (\cref{fig:videomeeting}) from a single video source with no metadata on participant locations, while using the least amount of constraints and assumptions as to how the data was acquired. Conventional approaches often use YOLO models coupled with tracking algorithms, assuming linear motion trajectories akin to that observed in CCTV footage. However, such assumptions fall short in virtual meetings, where participant video feed window can abruptly change location across the grid. In an organic video meeting setting, participants frequently join and leave, leading to sudden, non-linear movements on the video grid. This disrupts optical flow-based tracking methods that depend on linear motion. Consequently, standard object detection and tracking methods might mistakenly assign multiple participants to the same tracker. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to track and re-identify participants in remote video meetings, by utilizing the spatio-temporal priors arising from the data in our domain. This, in turn, increases tracking capabilities compared to the use of general object tracking. Our approach reduces the error rate by 95% on average compared to YOLO-based tracking methods as a baseline.

While end-to-end methods have gained significant interest in single-camera tracking, multi-camera tracking remains predominantly reliant on heuristic techniques. In response to this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Camera Tracking tRansformer (MCTR), a novel end-to-end approach tailored for multi-object detection and tracking across multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view. MCTR leverages end-to-end detectors like DEtector TRansformer (DETR) to produce detections and detection embeddings independently for each camera view. The framework maintains set of track embeddings that encaplusate global information about the tracked objects, and updates them at every frame by integrating the local information from the view-specific detection embeddings. The track embeddings are probabilistically associated with detections in every camera view and frame to generate consistent object tracks. The soft probabilistic association facilitates the design of differentiable losses that enable end-to-end training of the entire system. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on MMPTrack and AI City Challenge, two recently introduced large-scale multi-camera multi-object tracking datasets.

Most trackers focus on how to design a better data association strategy to improve the tracking performance. The rule-based handcrafted association methods are simple and highly efficient but lack generalization capability to deal with complex scenes. While the learnt association methods can learn high-order contextual information to deal with various complex scenes, but they have the limitations of higher complexity and cost. To address these limitations, we propose a Robust Two-stage Association Tracker, named RTAT. The first-stage association is performed between tracklets and detections to generate tracklets with high purity, and the second-stage association is performed between tracklets to form complete trajectories. For the first-stage association, we use a simple data association strategy to generate tracklets with high purity by setting a low threshold for the matching cost in the assignment process. We conduct the tracklet association in the second-stage based on the framework of message-passing GNN. Our method models the tracklet association as a series of edge classification problem in hierarchical graphs, which can recursively merge short tracklets into longer ones. Our tracker RTAT ranks first on the test set of MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks in most of the main MOT metrics: HOTA, IDF1, and AssA. We achieve 67.2 HOTA, 84.7 IDF1, and 69.7 AssA on MOT17, and 66.2 HOTA, 82.5 IDF1, and 68.1 AssA on MOT20.

In this work, we derive a batch update for the recently introduced elliptical-target tracker called MEM-EKF*. The MEM-EKF* is based on the same likelihood as the well-established random matrix approach but is derived from the multiplicative error model (MEM) and uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to update the target state sequentially, i.e., measurement-by-measurement. Our batch variant updates the target state in a single step based on straightforward sums over all measurements and the MEM-specific pseudo-measurements. This drastically reduces the scaling constant for typical implementations and indeed we find a speedup of roughly 100x in our numerical experiments. At the same time, the estimation error which we measure using the Gaussian Wasserstein distance stays significantly below that of the random matrix approach in coordinated turn scenarios while being comparable otherwise.

Yet, they are experiencing global population declines and effective monitoring of populations is essential to their protection. Underwater stationary videos, such as those from Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS), are critical for understanding elasmobranch spatial ecology and abundance. However, processing these videos requires time-consuming manual analysis that can delay conservation. To address this challenge, we developed SharkTrack, a semi-automatic underwater video analysis software. SharkTrack uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-Object Tracking to automatically detect and track elasmobranchs and provides an annotation pipeline to manually classify elasmobranch species and compute species-specific MaxN (ssMaxN), the standard metric of relative abundance. When tested on BRUVS footage from locations unseen by the CNN model during training, SharkTrack computed ssMaxN with 89% accuracy over 207 hours of footage. The semi-automatic SharkTrack pipeline required two minutes of manual classification per hour of video, an estimated 95% reduction of manual analysis time compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate SharkTrack accuracy across diverse marine ecosystems and elasmobranch species, an advancement compared to previous models, which were limited to specific species or locations. SharkTrack applications extend beyond BRUVS, facilitating the analysis of any underwater stationary video. By making video analysis faster and more accessible, SharkTrack enables research and conservation organisations to monitor elasmobranch populations more efficiently, thereby improving conservation efforts.

This dataset provides a synchronized stream of event data and grayscale images of traffic scenes, captured using the Dynamic and Active-Pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) 240c hybrid event-based camera. MEVDT comprises 63 multi-modal sequences with approximately 13k images, 5M events, 10k object labels, and 85 unique object tracking trajectories. Additionally, MEVDT includes manually annotated ground truth labels $\unicode{x2014}$ consisting of object classifications, pixel-precise bounding boxes, and unique object IDs $\unicode{x2014}$ which are provided at a labeling frequency of 24 Hz. Designed to advance the research in the domain of event-based vision, MEVDT aims to address the critical need for high-quality, real-world annotated datasets that enable the development and evaluation of object detection and tracking algorithms in automotive environments.

However, tracking methods trained on RGB datasets suffer a significant drop-off in TIR data due to the domain shift issue. To this end, in this work, we propose a Progressive Domain Adaptation framework for TIR Tracking (PDAT), which transfers useful knowledge learned from RGB tracking to TIR tracking. The framework makes full use of large-scale labeled RGB datasets without requiring time-consuming and labor-intensive labeling of large-scale TIR data. Specifically, we first propose an adversarial-based global domain adaptation module to reduce domain gap on the feature level coarsely. Second, we design a clustering-based subdomain adaptation method to further align the feature distributions of the RGB and TIR datasets finely. These two domain adaptation modules gradually eliminate the discrepancy between the two domains, and thus learn domain-invariant fine-grained features through progressive training. Additionally, we collect a largescale TIR dataset with over 1.48 million unlabeled TIR images for training the proposed domain adaptation framework. Experimental results on five TIR tracking benchmarks show that the proposed method gains a nearly 6% success rate, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Current tracking algorithms can be divided into two main categories: some approaches introduce complex heuristics and re-identification models to improve the tracking accuracy and reduce the number of identification switches, without particular attention to the timing performance, whereas other approaches are aimed at reducing response times by removing the re-identification phase, thus penalizing the tracking accuracy. This work proposes a new approach to multi-class object tracking that allows achieving smaller and more predictable execution times, without penalizing the tracking performance. The idea is to reduce the problem of matching predictions with detections into smaller sub-problems by splitting the Hungarian matrix by class and invoking the second re-identification stage only when strictly necessary for a smaller number of elements. The proposed solution was evaluated in complex urban scenarios with several objects of different types (as cars, trucks, bikes, and pedestrians), showing the effectiveness of the multi-class approach with respect to state of the art trackers.

The development of machine learning-based detection and tracking methodologies has been used for helping automated monitoring and prediction of strawberry yield, still, enhancement has been limited as previous studies only applied the deep learning method for flower and fruit detection, which did not consider the unique characteristics of image datasets collected by the machine vision system. This study proposed an optimal pruning of detection heads of the deep learning model (YOLOv7 and its variants) that could achieve fast and precise strawberry flower, immature fruit, and mature fruit detection. Thereafter, an enhanced object tracking algorithm, which is called the Information Based Tracking Algorithm (IBTA) utilized the best detection result, removed the Kalman Filter, and integrated moving direction, velocity, and spatial information to improve the precision in strawberry flower and fruit tracking. The proposed pruning of detection heads across YOLOv7 variants, notably Pruning-YOLOv7-tiny with detection head 3 and Pruning-YOLOv7-tiny with heads 2 and 3 achieved the best inference speed (163.9 frames per second) and detection accuracy (89.1%), respectively. On the other hand, the effect of IBTA was proved by comparing it with the centroid tracking algorithm (CTA), the Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and Multiple Object Tracking Precision (MOTP) of IBTA were 12.3% and 6.0% higher than that of CTA, accordingly. In addition, other object-tracking evaluation metrics, including IDF1, IDR, IDP, MT, and IDs, show that IBTA performed better than CTA in strawberry flower and fruit tracking.

Our method applies a successive shortest paths (SSP) algorithm to a tracking graph defined over a batch of frames. The edge costs in this tracking graph are computed via a message-passing network, a graph neural network (GNN) variant. The parameters of the GNN, and hence, the tracker, are learned end-to-end on a training set of example ground-truth tracks and detections. Specifically, learning takes the form of bilevel optimization guided by our novel loss function. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated scenarios to understand its sensitivity to scenario aspects and model hyperparameters. Across varied scenario complexities, our method compares favorably to a strong baseline.

Vision-based maritime surveillance is challenging mainly due to visibility issues at night, which results in failures in re-identifying vessels and detecting suspicious activities. In this paper, we introduce a thermal, vision-based approach for maritime surveillance with object tracking, vessel re-identification, and suspicious activity detection capabilities. For vessel re-identification, we propose a novel viewpoint-independent algorithm which compares features of the sides of the vessel separately (separate side-spaces) leveraging shape information in the absence of color features. We propose techniques to adapt tracking and activity detection algorithms for the thermal domain and train them using a thermal dataset we created. This dataset will be the first publicly available benchmark dataset for thermal maritime surveillance. Our system is capable of re-identifying vessels with an 81.8% Top1 score and identifying suspicious activities with a 72.4\% frame mAP score; a new benchmark for each task in the thermal domain.

Yet, analyzing vast, unlabeled video data, often spanning hours, remains a challenge for machine learning, especially in computer vision. Existing approaches often analyze only a few frames. Our focus is on long-term animal behavior analysis. To address this challenge, we utilize classical probabilistic methods for state estimation, such as particle filtering. By incorporating recent advancements in semantic object segmentation, we enable continuous tracking of rapidly evolving object formations, even in scenarios with limited data availability. Particle filters offer a provably optimal algorithmic structure for recursively adding new incoming information. We propose a novel approach for tracking schools of fish in the open ocean from drone videos. Our framework not only performs classical object tracking in 2D, instead it tracks the position and spatial expansion of the fish school in world coordinates by fusing video data and the drone's on board sensor information (GPS and IMU). The presented framework for the first time allows researchers to study collective behavior of fish schools in its natural social and environmental context in a non-invasive and scalable way.

However, its dependency on real depth inputs and the complexity involved in multi-modal fusion limit its applicability across various scenarios. The utilization of depth information in RGB-D tracking inspired us to propose a new method, named MDETrack, which trains a tracking network with an additional capability to understand the depth of scenes, through supervised or self-supervised auxiliary Monocular Depth Estimation learning. The outputs of MDETrack's unified feature extractor are fed to the side-by-side tracking head and auxiliary depth estimation head, respectively. The auxiliary module will be discarded in inference, thus keeping the same inference speed. We evaluated our models with various training strategies on multiple datasets, and the results show an improved tracking accuracy even without real depth. Through these findings we highlight the potential of depth estimation in enhancing object tracking performance.

In this project, we aim to develop a sophisticated aerial vehicle system known as Track Anything Rapter (TAR), designed to detect, segment, and track objects of interest based on user-provided multimodal queries, such as text, images, and clicks. TAR utilizes cutting-edge pre-trained models like DINO, CLIP, and SAM to estimate the relative pose of the queried object. The tracking problem is approached as a Visual Servoing task, enabling the UAV to consistently focus on the object through advanced motion planning and control algorithms. We showcase how the integration of these foundational models with a custom high-level control algorithm results in a highly stable and precise tracking system deployed on a custom-built PX4 Autopilot-enabled Voxl2 M500 drone. To validate the tracking algorithm's performance, we compare it against Vicon-based ground truth. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability of the foundational models in aiding tracking in scenarios involving occlusions. Finally, we test and validate the model's ability to work seamlessly with multiple modalities, such as click, bounding box, and image templates.

The proposed solution, referred to as "Air Signature," involves writing the signature in front of the camera, rather than relying on traditional methods such as mouse drawing or physically signing on paper and showing it to a web camera. The goal is to develop a state-of-the-art method for detecting and tracking gestures and objects in real-time. The proposed methods include applying existing gesture recognition and object tracking systems, improving accuracy through smoothing and line drawing, and maintaining continuity during fast finger movements. An evaluation of the fingertip detection, sketching, and overall signing process is performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The secondary objective of this research is to develop a model that can effectively recognize the unique signature of a user. This type of signature can be verified by neural cores that analyze the movement, speed, and stroke pixels of the signing in real time. The neural cores use machine learning algorithms to match air signatures to the individual's stored signatures, providing a secure and efficient method of verification. Our proposed System does not require sensors or any hardware other than the camera.

Usually, state-of-the-art methods focus on bringing novel ideas in the visual encoding or relational modelling phases. However, in this work, we show that bounding box regression from learned joint search and template features is of high importance as well. While previous methods relied heavily on well-learned features representing interactions between search and template, we hypothesize that the receptive field of the input convolutional bounding box network plays an important role in accurately determining the object location. To this end, we introduce two novel bounding box regression networks: inception and deformable. Experiments and ablation studies show that our inception module installed on the recent ODTrack outperforms the latter on three benchmarks: the GOT-10k, the UAV123 and the OTB2015.

We choose cloth and rope because they are traditionally some of the most difficult deformable objects to analytically model with their large configuration space, and they are meaningful in the context of robotic tasks like cloth folding, rope knot-tying, T-shirt folding, curtain closing, etc. The correspondence problem is heavily motivated in robotics, with wide-ranging applications including semantic grasping, object tracking, and manipulation policies built on top of correspondences. We present an exhaustive survey of existing classical methods for doing correspondence via feature-matching, including SIFT, SURF, and ORB, and two recently published learning-based methods including TimeCycle and Dense Object Nets. We make three main contributions: (1) a framework for simulating and rendering synthetic images of deformable objects, with qualitative results demonstrating transfer between our simulated and real domains (2) a new learning-based correspondence method extending Dense Object Nets, and (3) a standardized comparison across state-of-the-art correspondence methods. Our proposed method provides a flexible, general formulation for learning temporally and spatially continuous correspondences for nonrigid (and rigid) objects. We report root mean squared error statistics for all methods and find that Dense Object Nets outperforms baseline classical methods for correspondence, and our proposed extension of Dense Object Nets performs similarly.

We aim to create an advanced smart retail analytics system (SRAS), leveraging these technologies to enhance retail efficiency and customer engagement. To enhance customer tracking capabilities, a new hybrid architecture is proposed integrating several predictive models. In the first stage of the proposed hybrid architecture for customer tracking, we fine-tuned the YOLOV8 algorithm using a diverse set of parameters, achieving exceptional results across various performance metrics. This fine-tuning process utilized actual surveillance footage from retail environments, ensuring its practical applicability. In the second stage, we explored integrating two sophisticated object-tracking models, BOT-SORT and ByteTrack, with the labels detected by YOLOV8. This integration is crucial for tracing customer paths within stores, which facilitates the creation of accurate visitor counts and heat maps. These insights are invaluable for understanding consumer behavior and improving store operations. To optimize inventory management, we delved into various predictive models, optimizing and contrasting their performance against complex retail data patterns. The GRU model, with its ability to interpret time-series data with long-range temporal dependencies, consistently surpassed other models like Linear Regression, showing 2.873% and 29.31% improvements in R2-score and mAPE, respectively.

While the performance of these JCAS schemes for object tracking and parameter estimation has been studied in previous works, their performance on target detection in the presence of clutter has not been analyzed. In this paper, we propose a detection scheme for estimating the number of targets in JCAS cellular networks that employ TDM or CM resource sharing. The proposed detection method allows for the presence of clutter and/or temporally correlated noise. This scheme is studied with respect to the JCAS trade-off parameters that allow to control the time slots in TDM and the power resources in CM allocated to sensing and communications. The performance of two fundamental transmit beamforming schemes, typical for JCAS, is compared in terms of the receiver operating characteristics curves. Our results indicate that in general the TDM scheme gives a somewhat better detection performance compared to the CM scheme, although both schemes outperform existing approaches provided that their respective trade-off parameters are tuned properly.

This versatility, along with the relatively inexpensive availability of machine vision cameras, played an important role in adopting vision-based environment perception systems in autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, vision-based perception systems can be easily affected by glare in the presence of a bright source of light, such as the sun or the headlights of the oncoming vehicle at night or simply by light reflecting off snow or ice-covered surfaces; scenarios encountered frequently during driving. In this paper, we investigate various glare reduction techniques, including the proposed saturated pixel-aware glare reduction technique for improved performance of the computer vision (CV) tasks employed by the perception layer of AVs. We evaluate these glare reduction methods based on various performance metrics of the CV algorithms used by the perception layer. Specifically, we considered object detection, object recognition, object tracking, depth estimation, and lane detection which are crucial for autonomous driving. The experimental findings validate the efficacy of the proposed glare reduction approach, showcasing enhanced performance across diverse perception tasks and remarkable resilience against varying levels of glare.

Disposing of trash in unplanned places poses serious health and environmental risks. We should try to restrict public trash cans as much as possible. This research focuses on automating the penalization of litterbugs, addressing the persistent problem of littering in public places. Traditional approaches relying on manual intervention and witness reporting suffer from delays, inaccuracies, and anonymity issues. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a fully automated system that utilizes surveillance cameras and advanced computer vision algorithms for litter detection, object tracking, and face recognition. The system accurately identifies and tracks individuals engaged in littering activities, attaches their identities through face recognition, and enables efficient enforcement of anti-littering policies. By reducing reliance on manual intervention, minimizing human error, and providing prompt identification, the proposed system offers significant advantages in addressing littering incidents. The primary contribution of this research lies in the implementation of the proposed system, leveraging advanced technologies to enhance surveillance operations and automate the penalization of litterbugs.

Yet, it remains hindered by two major challenges: 1) the trade-off between performance and efficiency; 2) the scarcity of training data. To address the latter challenge, some recent methods employ prompts to fine-tune pre-trained RGB tracking models and leverage upstream knowledge in a parameter-efficient manner. However, these methods inadequately explore modality-independent patterns and disregard the dynamic reliability of different modalities in open scenarios. We propose M3PT, a novel RGB-T prompt tracking method that leverages middle fusion and multi-modal and multi-stage visual prompts to overcome these challenges. We pioneer the use of the adjustable middle fusion meta-framework for RGB-T tracking, which could help the tracker balance the performance with efficiency, to meet various demands of application. Furthermore, based on the meta-framework, we utilize multiple flexible prompt strategies to adapt the pre-trained model to comprehensive exploration of uni-modal patterns and improved modeling of fusion-modal features in diverse modality-priority scenarios, harnessing the potential of prompt learning in RGB-T tracking. Evaluating on 6 existing challenging benchmarks, our method surpasses previous state-of-the-art prompt fine-tuning methods while maintaining great competitiveness against excellent full-parameter fine-tuning methods, with only 0.34M fine-tuned parameters.

Existing methods track by appearance-based similarity or long-term relation modeling, resulting in rich temporal contexts between consecutive frames being easily overlooked. Moreover, training trackers from scratch or fine-tuning large pre-trained models needs more time and memory consumption. In this paper, we present ACTrack, a new tracking framework with additive spatio-temporal conditions. It preserves the quality and capabilities of the pre-trained Transformer backbone by freezing its parameters, and makes a trainable lightweight additive net to model spatio-temporal relations in tracking. We design an additive siamese convolutional network to ensure the integrity of spatial features and perform temporal sequence modeling to simplify the tracking pipeline. Experimental results on several benchmarks prove that ACTrack could balance training efficiency and tracking performance.

With the technological advances, they can be seen in most of the aspects of life from filming to logistics. The increased use of drones made it sometimes essential to form a collaboration between them to perform the task efficiently in a defined process. This paper investigates the use of a combined centralised and decentralised architecture for the collaborative operation of drones in a parts delivery scenario to enable and expedite the operation of the factories of the future. The centralised and decentralised approaches were extensively researched, with experimentation being undertaken to determine the appropriateness of each approach for this use-case. Decentralised control was utilised to remove the need for excessive communication during the operation of the drones, resulting in smoother operations. Initial results suggested that the decentralised approach is more appropriate for this use-case. The individual functionalities necessary for the implementation of a decentralised architecture were proven and assessed, determining that a combination of multiple individual functionalities, namely VSLAM, dynamic collision avoidance and object tracking, would give an appropriate solution for use in an industrial setting. A final architecture for the parts delivery system was proposed for future work, using a combined centralised and decentralised approach to combat the limitations inherent in each architecture.

However, existing advanced methods often overlook the diversity among trajectories and the ambiguity and conflicts present in motion and appearance cues, leading to confusion among detections, trajectories, and associations when performing simple global data association. To address this issue, we propose a simple, versatile, and highly interpretable data association approach called Decomposed Data Association (DDA). DDA decomposes the traditional association problem into multiple sub-problems using a series of non-learning-based modules and selectively addresses the confusion in each sub-problem by incorporating targeted exploitation of new cues. Additionally, we introduce Occlusion-aware Non-Maximum Suppression (ONMS) to retain more occluded detections, thereby increasing opportunities for association with trajectories and indirectly reducing the confusion caused by missed detections. Finally, based on DDA and ONMS, we design a powerful multi-object tracker named DeconfuseTrack, specifically focused on resolving confusion in MOT. Extensive experiments conducted on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate that our proposed DDA and ONMS significantly enhance the performance of several popular trackers. Moreover, DeconfuseTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MOT17 and MOT20 test sets, significantly outperforms the baseline tracker ByteTrack in metrics such as HOTA, IDF1, AssA. This validates that our tracking design effectively reduces confusion caused by simple global association.

Most state-of-the-art approaches first detect objects in each frame and then implement data association between new detections and existing tracks using motion models and appearance similarities. Despite achieving satisfactory results, occlusion and crowds can easily lead to missing and distorted detections, followed by missing and false associations. In this paper, we first revisit the classic tracker DeepSORT, enhancing its robustness over crowds and occlusion significantly by placing greater trust in predictions when detections are unavailable or of low quality in crowded and occluded scenes. Specifically, we propose a new framework comprising of three lightweight and plug-and-play algorithms: the probability map, the prediction map, and the covariance adaptive Kalman filter. The probability map identifies whether undetected objects have genuinely disappeared from view (e.g., out of the image or entered a building) or are only temporarily undetected due to occlusion or other reasons. Trajectories of undetected targets that are still within the probability map are extended by state estimations directly. The prediction map determines whether an object is in a crowd, and we prioritize state estimations over observations when severe deformation of observations occurs, accomplished through the covariance adaptive Kalman filter. The proposed method, named MapTrack, achieves state-of-the-art results on popular multi-object tracking benchmarks such as MOT17 and MOT20. Despite its superior performance, our method remains simple, online, and real-time. The code will be open-sourced later.

Moreover, it is not intuitive for non-experts to label 3D ground truth (e.g. 6DoF object pose) on 2D images. To address these issues, we present "blender-hoisynth", an interactive synthetic data generator based on the Blender software. Blender-hoisynth can scalably generate and automatically annotate visual HOI training data. Other competing approaches usually generate synthetic HOI data compeletely without human input. While this may be beneficial in some scenarios, HOI applications inherently necessitate direct control over the HOIs as an expression of human intent. With blender-hoisynth, it is possible for users to interact with objects via virtual hands using standard Virtual Reality hardware. The synthetically generated data are characterized by a high degree of photorealism and contain visually plausible and physically realistic videos of hands grasping objects and moving them around in 3D. To demonstrate the efficacy of our data generation, we replace large parts of the training data in the well-known DexYCB dataset with hoisynth data and train a state-of-the-art HOI reconstruction model with it. We show that there is no significant degradation in the model performance despite the data replacement.

Additionally, soft actuators are often unable to support human-scale loads due to the extremely compliant materials in use. Developing both feedback control and the ability to actuate under large loads (e.g. 500 N) are key capacities required to move soft robotics into everyday applications. In this work, we independently demonstrate these key factors towards controlling and actuating human-scale loads: proprioceptive (embodied) feedback control of a soft, pneumatically-actuated origami robot; and actuation of these origami origami robots under a person's weight in an open-loop configuration. In both demonstrations, the actuators are controlled by internal fluidic pressure. Capacitive sensors patterned onto the robot provide position estimation and serve as input to a feedback controller. We demonstrate position control of a single actuator during stepped setpoints and sinusoidal trajectory following, with root mean square error (RMSE) below 4 mm. We also showcase the actuator's potential towards human-scale robotics as an "origami balance board" by joining three actuators into an open-loop controlled system with a platform that varies its height, roll, and pitch. This work contributes to the field of soft robotics by demonstrating closed-loop feedback position control without visual tracking as an input and lightweight, soft actuators that can support a person's weight.

Despite considerable advancements, existing MOT methodologies tend to falter when faced with non-uniform movements, occlusions, and appearance-reappearance scenarios of the objects. Recognizing this inadequacy, we put forward an integrated MOT method that not only marries object detection and identity linkage within a singular, end-to-end trainable framework but also equips the model with the ability to maintain object identity links over long periods of time. Our proposed model, named STMMOT, is built around four key modules: 1) candidate proposal generation, which generates object proposals via a vision-transformer encoder-decoder architecture that detects the object from each frame in the video; 2) scale variant pyramid, a progressive pyramid structure to learn the self-scale and cross-scale similarities in multi-scale feature maps; 3) spatio-temporal memory encoder, extracting the essential information from the memory associated with each object under tracking; and 4) spatio-temporal memory decoder, simultaneously resolving the tasks of object detection and identity association for MOT. Our system leverages a robust spatio-temporal memory module that retains extensive historical observations and effectively encodes them using an attention-based aggregator. The uniqueness of STMMOT lies in representing objects as dynamic query embeddings that are updated continuously, which enables the prediction of object states with attention mechanisms and eradicates the need for post-processing.

The issue becomes extremely challenging in dynamic field environments. Yet, this information is critical for making day-to-day agricultural decisions, assisting breeding programs, and much more. To tackle this dilemma, we introduce NTrack, a novel multiple object tracking framework based on the linear relationship between the locations of neighboring tracks. NTrack computes dense optical flow and utilizes particle filtering to guide each tracker. Correspondences between detections and tracks are found through data association via direct observations and indirect cues, which are then combined to obtain an updated observation. Our modular multiple object tracking system is independent of the underlying detection method, thus allowing for the interchangeable use of any off-the-shelf object detector. We show the efficacy of our approach on the task of tracking and counting infield cotton bolls. Experimental results show that our system exceeds contemporary tracking and cotton boll-based counting methods by a large margin. Furthermore, we publicly release the first annotated cotton boll video dataset to the research community.

Meanwhile, the manipulator may encounter certain challenges, including restricted motion due to kinematic constraints and the risk of colliding with external obstacles. These challenges are typically addressed by assigning multiple task objectives to the manipulator. However, doing so can cause an increased risk of driving the manipulator to its kinematic limits, leading to failures in object tracking or obstacle avoidance. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual tracking control method for a redundant manipulator that takes the kinematic constraints into account via a reachability measure. Our method employs an optimization-based controller that considers object tracking, occlusion avoidance, collision avoidance, and the kinematic constraints represented by the reachability measure. Subsequently, it determines a suitable joint configuration through real-time inverse kinematics, accounting for dynamic obstacle avoidance and the continuity of joint configurations. To validate our approach, we conducted simulations and hardware experiments involving a moving target and dynamic obstacles. The results of our evaluations highlight the significance of incorporating the reachability measure.

However, the majority of the present methods concentrate exclusively on minimizing cost functions whose values may not indicate accurate solutions under occlusions. In this paper, by exploiting the properties of tracklets intersections and low-confidence detections, we develop a two-stage tracking pipeline with an intersection mask that can accurately locate inaccurate tracklets which are corrected in the second stage. Specifically, we employ the minimum network flow algorithm with high-confidence detections as input in the first stage to obtain the candidate tracklets that need correction. Then we leverage the intersection mask to accurately locate the inaccurate parts of candidate tracklets. The second stage utilizes low-confidence detections that may be attributed to occlusions for correcting inaccurate tracklets. This process constructs a graph of nodes in inaccurate tracklets and low-confidence nodes and uses it for the second round of minimum network flow calculation. We perform sufficient experiments on popular MOT benchmark datasets and achieve 78.4 MOTA on the test set of MOT16, 79.2 on MOT17, and 76.4 on MOT20, which shows that the proposed method is effective.

However, when multiple marked nodes exist, the conventional search algorithm lacks the capacity to simultaneously amplify the marked nodes as well as identify the correct chronological ordering between the marked nodes, if any. To address this limitation, we explore a potential extension of the algorithm by introducing additional quantum states to label the marked nodes. The labels resolve the ambiguity of simultaneous amplification of the marked nodes. Additionally, by associating the label states with a chronological ordering, we can extend the algorithm to track a moving particle on a two-dimensional surface. Our algorithm efficiently searches for the trajectory of the particle and is supported by a proposed quantum circuit. This concept holds promise for a range of applications, from real-time object tracking to network management and routing.

Despite impressive tracking outcomes achieved by multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms for pedestrian and vehicle datasets, these models and techniques exhibit poor performance when applied to ship datasets. Intersection of Union (IoU) is the most popular metric for computing similarity used in object tracking. The low frame rates and severe image shake caused by wave turbulence in ship datasets often result in minimal, or even zero, Intersection of Union (IoU) between the predicted and detected bounding boxes. This issue contributes to frequent identity switches of tracked objects, undermining the tracking performance. In this paper, we address the weaknesses of IoU by incorporating the smallest convex shapes that enclose both the predicted and detected bounding boxes. The calculation of the tracking version of IoU (TIoU) metric considers not only the size of the overlapping area between the detection bounding box and the prediction box, but also the similarity of their shapes. Through the integration of the TIoU into state-of-the-art object tracking frameworks, such as DeepSort and ByteTrack, we consistently achieve improvements in the tracking performance of these frameworks.

However, objects might be temporally occluded. Such occlusion scenarios in the datasets are common yet underexplored in offline auto labeling. In this work, we propose an offline tracking model that focuses on occluded object tracks. It leverages the concept of object permanence which means objects continue to exist even if they are not observed anymore. The model contains three parts: a standard online tracker, a re-identification (Re-ID) module that associates tracklets before and after occlusion, and a track completion module that completes the fragmented tracks. The Re-ID module and the track completion module use the vectorized map as one of the inputs to refine the tracking results with occlusion. The model can effectively recover the occluded object trajectories. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D multi-object tracking by significantly improving the original online tracking result, showing its potential to be applied in offline auto labeling as a useful plugin to improve tracking by recovering occlusions.

Recently, the use of graph-based approaches to solve tracking problems has become very popular. However, many current graph-based methods do not effectively utilize information regarding spatial and temporal consistency. Instead, they rely on single-camera trackers as input, which are prone to fragmentation and ID switch errors. In this paper, we propose a novel reconfigurable graph model that first associates all detected objects across cameras spatially before reconfiguring it into a temporal graph for Temporal Association. This two-stage association approach enables us to extract robust spatial and temporal-aware features and address the problem with fragmented tracklets. Furthermore, our model is designed for online tracking, making it suitable for real-world applications. Experimental results show that the proposed graph model is able to extract more discriminating features for object tracking, and our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets.

As a result, CVM detects the mismatch between the prior dynamic model and actual motion pattern to correct the filtering gain, and simultaneously becomes a nonlinear and state-coupled model with multiplicative noise. The study considers CVM to design a feasible distributed weighted least squares (WLS) filter. The WLS criterion requires a linear state-space model containing only additive noise about the estimated state. To meet the requirement, we derive such two separate pseudo-linearized models by using the first-order Taylor series expansion. The separation is merely in form, and the estimates of interested states are embedded as parameters into each other's model, which implies that their interdependency is still preserved in the iterative operation of two linear filters. With the two models, we first propose a centralized WLS filter by converting the measurements from all nodes into a summation form. Then, a distributed consensus scheme, which directly performs an inner iteration on the priors across different nodes, is proposed to incorporate the cross-covariances between nodes. Under the consensus scheme, a distributed WLS filter over a realistic network with ``naive'' node is developed by proper weighting of the priors and measurements. Finally, the performance of proposed filters in terms of accuracy, robustness, and consistency is testified under different prior situations.

UAVs offer low-cost platforms with flexible hardware configurations, as well as an increasing number of autonomous capabilities, including take-off, landing, object tracking and obstacle avoidance. However, little attention has been paid to how UAVs deal with object detection uncertainties caused by false readings from vision-based detectors, data noise, vibrations, and occlusion. In most situations, the relevance and understanding of these detections are delegated to human operators, as many UAVs have limited cognition power to interact autonomously with the environment. This paper presents a framework for autonomous navigation under uncertainty in outdoor scenarios for small UAVs using a probabilistic-based motion planner. The framework is evaluated with real flight tests using a sub 2 kg quadrotor UAV and illustrated in victim finding Search and Rescue (SAR) case study in a forest/bushland. The navigation problem is modelled using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and solved in real time onboard the small UAV using Augmented Belief Trees (ABT) and the TAPIR toolkit. Results from experiments using colour and thermal imagery show that the proposed motion planner provides accurate victim localisation coordinates, as the UAV has the flexibility to interact with the environment and obtain clearer visualisations of any potential victims compared to the baseline motion planner. Incorporating this system allows optimised UAV surveillance operations by diminishing false positive readings from vision-based object detectors.

An effective method to tackle these challenges is template update, which updates the template to reflect the change of appearance in the target object during tracking. However, with template updates, inadequate quality of new templates or inappropriate timing of updates may induce a model drift problem, which severely degrades the tracking performance. Here, we propose BackTrack, a robust and reliable method to quantify the confidence of the candidate template by backward tracking it on the past frames. Based on the confidence score of candidates from BackTrack, we can update the template with a reliable candidate at the right time while rejecting unreliable candidates. BackTrack is a generic template update scheme and is applicable to any template-based trackers. Extensive experiments on various tracking benchmarks verify the effectiveness of BackTrack over existing template update algorithms, as it achieves SOTA performance on various tracking benchmarks.

Classical Kalman Filtering based methods are still the most popular solutions. However, these methods require handcrafted designs in motion modeling and can not benefit from the growing data amounts. In this paper, Box Only Transformer Tracker (BOTT) is proposed to learn to link 3D boxes of the same object from the different frames, by taking all the 3D boxes in a time window as input. Specifically, transformer self-attention is applied to exchange information between all the boxes to learn global-informative box embeddings. The similarity between these learned embeddings can be used to link the boxes of the same object. BOTT can be used for both online and offline tracking modes seamlessly. Its simplicity enables us to significantly reduce engineering efforts required by traditional Kalman Filtering based methods. Experiments show BOTT achieves competitive performance on two largest 3D MOT benchmarks: 69.9 and 66.7 AMOTA on nuScenes validation and test splits, respectively, 56.45 and 59.57 MOTA L2 on Waymo Open Dataset validation and test splits, respectively. This work suggests that tracking 3D objects by learning features directly from 3D boxes using transformers is a simple yet effective way.

Recently ego-motion constraint obtained by Inertial measurement unit (IMU) preintegration has been extensively used in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to alleviate the computation burden. This paper introduces an extended preintegration incorporating the IMU preintegration of two platforms to formulate the motion constraint of relative state. One merit of this analytic constraint is that it can be seamlessly integrated into the unified graph optimization framework to implement the relative state estimation in a high-performance real-time tracking thread, another point is a full smoother design with this precise constraint to optimize the 3D coordinate and refine the state for the refinement thread. We compare extensively in simulations the proposed algorithms with two existing approaches to confirm our outperformance. In the real virtual reality (VR) application design with the proposed estimator, we properly realize the visual tracking of the six degrees of freedom (6DoF) controller suitable for almost all scenarios, including the challenging environment with missing features, light mutation, dynamic scenes, etc. The demo video is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0idb9Ls2iAM.

Currently, most methods for multi-object tracking model the motion information and combine it with appearance information to determine and track objects. In this paper, unfalsified control is employed to address the ID-switch problem in multi-object tracking. We establish sequences of appearance information variations for the trajectories during the tracking process and design a detection and rectification module specifically for ID-switch detection and recovery. We also propose a simple and effective strategy to address the issue of ambiguous matching of appearance information during the data association process. Experimental results on publicly available MOT datasets demonstrate that the tracker exhibits excellent effectiveness and robustness in handling tracking errors caused by occlusions and rapid movements.

Conventional MOT models are built upon the multi-step modules listed above, and thus the computational cost is high. Our proposed end-to-end MOT model, \textit{TicrossNet}, is composed of a base detector and a cross-attention module only. As a result, the overhead of tracking does not increase significantly even when the number of instances ($N_t$) increases. We show that TicrossNet runs \textit{in real-time}; specifically, it achieves 32.6 FPS on MOT17 and 31.0 FPS on MOT20 (Tesla V100), which includes as many as $>$100 instances per frame. We also demonstrate that TicrossNet is robust to $N_t$; thus, it does not have to change the size of the base detector, depending on $N_t$, as is often done by other models for real-time processing.

However, traditional stereo vision systems that use rectilinear lenses may not be suitable for certain scenarios due to their limited field of view. This has led to the popularity of vision systems based on one or multiple fisheye cameras in different orientations, which can provide a field of view of 180x180 degrees or more. However, fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion at the edges that affects the accuracy of stereo matching and depth estimation. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a method for distortion-removal and depth estimation analysis for stereovision system using orthogonally divergent fisheye cameras (ODFC). The proposed method uses two virtual pinhole cameras (VPC), each VPC captures a small portion of the original view and presents it without any lens distortions, emulating the behavior of a pinhole camera. By carefully selecting the captured regions, it is possible to create a stereo pair using two VPCs. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in both simulation using virtual environment and experiments using real cameras and their results compared to stereo cameras with parallel optical axes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of distortion removal and depth estimation accuracy.

Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in challenging these conditions. However, most deep learning-based object trackers only use visible band (RGB) images. Thermal infrared electromagnetic waves (TIR) can provide additional information about an object, including its temperature, when faced with challenging conditions. We propose a deep learning-based image tracking approach that fuses RGB and thermal images (RGBT). The proposed model consists of two main components: a feature extractor and a tracker. The feature extractor encodes deep features from both the RGB and the TIR images. The tracker then uses these features to track the object using an enhanced attribute-based architecture. We propose a fusion of attribute-specific feature selection with an aggregation module. The proposed methods are evaluated on the RGBT234 \cite{LiCLiang2018} and LasHeR \cite{LiLasher2021} datasets, which are the most widely used RGBT object-tracking datasets in the literature. The results show that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art RGBT object trackers on these datasets, with a relatively smaller number of parameters.

End-to-end transformer-based algorithms, which detect and track objects simultaneously, show great potential for the MOT task. However, most existing methods focus on image-based tracking with a single object category. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based MOT algorithm (MotionTrack) with multi-modality sensor inputs to track objects with multiple classes. Our objective is to establish a transformer baseline for the MOT in an autonomous driving environment. The proposed algorithm consists of a transformer-based data association (DA) module and a transformer-based query enhancement module to achieve MOT and Multiple Object Detection (MOD) simultaneously. The MotionTrack and its variations achieve better results (AMOTA score at 0.55) on the nuScenes dataset compared with other classical baseline models, such as the AB3DMOT, the CenterTrack, and the probabilistic 3D Kalman filter. In addition, we prove that a modified attention mechanism can be utilized for DA to accomplish the MOT, and aggregate history features to enhance the MOD performance.

Previous research in this area has focused extensively on tactile perception of contact poses as this is an important capability needed for tasks such as traversing an object's surface or edge, manipulating an object, or pushing an object along a predetermined path. Another important capability needed for tasks such as object tracking and manipulation is estimation of post-contact shear but this has received much less attention. Indeed, post-contact shear has often been considered a "nuisance variable" and is removed if possible because it can have an adverse effect on other types of tactile perception such as contact pose estimation. This paper proposes a tactile robotic system that can simultaneously estimate both the contact pose and post-contact shear, and use this information to control its interaction with other objects. Moreover, our new system is capable of interacting with other objects in a smooth and continuous manner, unlike the stepwise, position-controlled systems we have used in the past. We demonstrate the capabilities of our new system using several different controller configurations, on tasks including object tracking, surface following, single-arm object pushing, and dual-arm object pushing.

In this paper, we examine the problem of learning a dictionary that is invariant under a pre-specified group of transformations. Natural settings include Cryo-EM, multi-object tracking, synchronization, pose estimation, etc. We specifically study this problem under the lens of mathematical representation theory. Leveraging the power of non-abelian Fourier analysis for functions over compact groups, we prescribe an algorithmic recipe for learning dictionaries that obey such invariances. We relate the dictionary learning problem in the physical domain, which is naturally modelled as being infinite dimensional, with the associated computational problem, which is necessarily finite dimensional. We establish that the dictionary learning problem can be effectively understood as an optimization instance over certain matrix orbitopes having a particular block-diagonal structure governed by the irreducible representations of the group of symmetries. This perspective enables us to introduce a band-limiting procedure which obtains dimensionality reduction in applications. We provide guarantees for our computational ansatz to provide a desirable dictionary learning outcome. We apply our paradigm to investigate the dictionary learning problem for the groups SO(2) and SO(3). While the SO(2)-orbitope admits an exact spectrahedral description, substantially less is understood about the SO(3)-orbitope. We describe a tractable spectrahedral outer approximation of the SO(3)-orbitope, and contribute an alternating minimization paradigm to perform optimization in this setting. We provide numerical experiments to highlight the efficacy of our approach in learning SO(3)-invariant dictionaries, both on synthetic and on real world data.

Indeed, this is a very complex problem that involves understanding how knowledge is acquired and reused by humans as well as proposing mechanisms that allow artificial agents to reuse previous knowledge. Inspired by Jean Piaget's theory's first three sensorimotor substages, this work presents a cognitive agent based on CONAIM (Conscious Attention-Based Integrated Model) that can learn procedures incrementally. Throughout the paper, we show the cognitive functions required in each substage and how adding new functions helps address tasks previously unsolved by the agent. Experiments were conducted with a humanoid robot in a simulated environment modeled with the Cognitive Systems Toolkit (CST) performing an object tracking task. The system is modeled using a single procedural learning mechanism based on Reinforcement Learning. The increasing agent's cognitive complexity is managed by adding new terms to the reward function for each learning phase. Results show that this approach is capable of solving complex tasks incrementally.

Many of the methods following this paradigm use the object center keypoint for detection. However, we argue that the center point is not optimal since it is often not visible in crowded scenarios, which results in many missed detections when the objects are partially occluded. We propose TopTrack, a joint detection-and-tracking method that uses the top of the object as a keypoint for detection instead of the center because it is more often visible. Furthermore, TopTrack processes consecutive frames in separate streams in order to facilitate training. We performed experiments to show that using the object top as a keypoint for detection can reduce the amount of missed detections, which in turn leads to more complete trajectories and less lost trajectories. TopTrack manages to achieve competitive results with other state-of-the-art trackers on two MOT benchmarks.

To obtain training data for object detection model efficiently, many datasets opt to obtain their unannotated data in video format and the annotator needs to draw a bounding box around each object in the images. Annotating every frame from a video is costly and inefficient since many frames contain very similar information for the model to learn from. How to select the most informative frames from a video to annotate has become a highly practical task to solve but attracted little attention in research. In this paper, we proposed a novel active learning algorithm for object detection models to tackle this problem. In the proposed active learning algorithm, both classification and localization informativeness of unlabelled data are measured and aggregated. Utilizing the temporal information from video frames, two novel localization informativeness measurements are proposed. Furthermore, a weight curve is proposed to avoid querying adjacent frames. Proposed active learning algorithm with multiple configurations was evaluated on the MuPoTS dataset and FootballPD dataset.

MOT aims to maintain the identities of multiple objects across a series of continuous video sequences. In recent years, MOT has made rapid progress. However, modeling the motion and appearance models of objects in complex scenes still faces various challenging issues. In this paper, we design a novel direction consistency method for smooth trajectory prediction (STP-DC) to increase the modeling of motion information and overcome the lack of robustness in previous methods in complex scenes. Existing methods use pedestrian re-identification (Re-ID) to model appearance, however, they extract more background information which lacks discriminability in occlusion and crowded scenes. We propose a hyper-grain feature embedding network (HG-FEN) to enhance the modeling of appearance models, thus generating robust appearance descriptors. We also proposed other robustness techniques, including CF-ECM for storing robust appearance information and SK-AS for improving association accuracy. To achieve state-of-the-art performance in MOT, we propose a robust tracker named Rt-track, incorporating various tricks and techniques.

However, there are still great challenges in multi-object tracking. For example, when most part of a target is occluded or the target just disappears from images temporarily, it often leads to tracking interruptions for most of the existing tracking algorithms. Therefore, this study offers a bi-directional matching algorithm for multi-object tracking that makes advantage of bi-directional motion prediction information to improve occlusion handling. A stranded area is used in the matching algorithm to temporarily store the objects that fail to be tracked. When objects recover from occlusions, our method will first try to match them with objects in the stranded area to avoid erroneously generating new identities, thus forming a more continuous trajectory. Experiments show that our approach can improve the multi-object tracking performance in the presence of occlusions. In addition, this study provides an attentional up-sampling module that not only assures tracking accuracy but also accelerates training speed. In the MOT17 challenge, the proposed algorithm achieves 63.4% MOTA, 55.3% IDF1, and 20.1 FPS tracking speed.

Dynamic backgrounds poses a significant challenge here. Supervised deep learning-based techniques are currently considered state-of-the-art for this task. However, these methods require pixel-wise ground-truth labels, which can be time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised framework that can perform background subtraction without requiring per-pixel ground-truth labels. Our framework is trained on a moving object-free sequence of images and comprises two networks. The first network is an autoencoder that generates background images and prepares dynamic background images for training the second network. The dynamic background images are obtained by thresholding the background-subtracted images. The second network is a U-Net that uses the same object-free video for training and the dynamic background images as pixel-wise ground-truth labels. During the test phase, the input images are processed by the autoencoder and U-Net, which generate background and dynamic background images, respectively. The dynamic background image helps remove dynamic motion from the background-subtracted image, enabling us to obtain a foreground image that is free of dynamic artifacts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments on selected categories of the CDnet 2014 dataset and the I2R dataset. Our method outperformed all top-ranked unsupervised methods. We also achieved better results than one of the two existing weakly supervised methods, and our performance was similar to the other. Our proposed method is online, real-time, efficient, and requires minimal frame-level annotation, making it suitable for a wide range of real-world applications.

Some recent MOT methods extract features of the bounding box region or the center point as identity embeddings. However, when targets are occluded, these coarse-grained global representations become unreliable. To this end, we propose exploring diverse fine-grained representation, which describes appearance comprehensively from global and local perspectives. This fine-grained representation requires high feature resolution and precise semantic information. To effectively alleviate the semantic misalignment caused by indiscriminate contextual information aggregation, Flow Alignment FPN (FAFPN) is proposed for multi-scale feature alignment aggregation. It generates semantic flow among feature maps from different resolutions to transform their pixel positions. Furthermore, we present a Multi-head Part Mask Generator (MPMG) to extract fine-grained representation based on the aligned feature maps. Multiple parallel branches of MPMG allow it to focus on different parts of targets to generate local masks without label supervision. The diverse details in target masks facilitate fine-grained representation. Eventually, benefiting from a Shuffle-Group Sampling (SGS) training strategy with positive and negative samples balanced, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MOT17 and MOT20 test sets. Even on DanceTrack, where the appearance of targets is extremely similar, our method significantly outperforms ByteTrack by 5.0% on HOTA and 5.6% on IDF1. Extensive experiments have proved that diverse fine-grained representation makes Re-ID great again in MOT.

While standard object detection frameworks do not predict the actual depth of an object, this information is crucial to avoid collisions. In this paper, we propose several novel extensions to state-of-the-art methods for monocular object detection from images at long range. Firstly, we propose Sigmoid and ReLU-like encodings when modeling depth estimation as a regression task. Secondly, we frame the depth estimation as a classification problem and introduce a Soft-Argmax function in the calculation of the training loss. The extensions are exemplarily applied to the YOLOX object detection framework. We evaluate the performance using the Amazon Airborne Object Tracking dataset. In addition, we introduce the Fitness score as a new metric that jointly assesses both object detection and depth estimation performance. Our results show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches w.r.t. existing, as well as the proposed metrics.

In a typical walking droplet experiment, a liquid droplet, known as \textit{walker}, propels itself laterally on the free surface of a vibrating bath of the same liquid. This motion is the result of the interaction between the droplets and the surface waves generated by the droplet itself after each successive bounce. A walker can exhibit a highly irregular trajectory over the course of its motion, including rapid acceleration and complex interactions with the other walkers present in the same bath. In analogy with the hydrodynamic experiments, the granular matter experiments consist of a vibrating bath of very small solid particles and a larger solid \textit{intruder}. Like the fluid droplets, the intruder interacts with and travels the domain due to the waves of the bath but tends to move much slower and much less smoothly than the droplets. When multiple intruders are introduced, they also exhibit complex interactions with each other. We leverage the state-of-art object detection model YOLO and the Hungarian Algorithm to accurately extract the trajectory of a walker or intruder in real-time. Our proposed methodology is capable of tracking individual walker(s) or intruder(s) in digital images acquired from a broad spectrum of experimental settings and does not suffer from any identity-switch issues. Thus, the deep learning approach developed in this work could be used to automatize the efficient, fast and accurate extraction of observables of interests in walking droplet and granular flow experiments. Such extraction capabilities are critically enabling for downstream tasks such as building data-driven dynamical models for the coarse-grained dynamics and interactions of the objects of interest.

This work further explores a hybrid, multi-modal, approach for object detection and tracking that leverages state-of-the-art frame-based detectors complemented by hand-crafted event-based methods to improve the overall tracking performance with minimal computational overhead. The methods presented include event-based bounding box (BB) refinement that improves the precision of the resulting BBs, as well as a continuous event-based object detection method, to recover missed detections and generate inter-frame detections that enable a high-temporal-resolution tracking output. The advantages of these methods are quantitatively verified by an ablation study using the higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) metric. Results show significant performance gains resembled by an improvement in the HOTA from 56.6%, using only frames, to 64.1% and 64.9%, for the event and edge-based mask configurations combined with the two methods proposed, at the baseline framerate of 24Hz. Likewise, incorporating these methods with the same configurations has improved HOTA from 52.5% to 63.1%, and from 51.3% to 60.2% at the high-temporal-resolution tracking rate of 384Hz. Finally, a validation experiment is conducted to analyze the real-world single-object tracking performance using high-speed LiDAR. Empirical evidence shows that our approaches provide significant advantages compared to using frame-based object detectors at the baseline framerate of 24Hz and higher tracking rates of up to 500Hz.

To pursue higher performance of MOT in sports scenes, we introduce an innovative tracker named SportsTrack, we utilize tracking by detection as our detection paradigm. Then we will introduce a three-stage matching process to solve the motion blur and body overlapping in sports scenes. Meanwhile, we present another innovation point: one-to-many correspondence between detection bboxes and crowded tracks to handle the overlap of athletes' bodies during sports competitions. Compared to other trackers such as BOT-SORT and ByteTrack, We carefully restored edge-lost tracks that were ignored by other trackers. Finally, we reached the SOTA result in the SportsMOT dataset.

In general, state-of-the-art methods address this problem using deep neural networks which indeed yield satisfactory results. Nevertheless, the high computational cost of these methods makes them unsuitable for mobile devices where real-world applications usually take place. In addition, head-mounted displays such as AR glasses require at least 90~FPS to avoid motion sickness, which further complicates the problem. We propose a flexible-frame-rate object pose estimation and tracking system for mobile devices. It is a monocular visual-inertial-based system with a client-server architecture. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) pose propagation is performed on the client side for high speed tracking, and RGB image-based 3D pose estimation is performed on the server side to obtain accurate poses, after which the pose is sent to the client side for visual-inertial fusion, where we propose a bias self-correction mechanism to reduce drift. We also propose a pose inspection algorithm to detect tracking failures and incorrect pose estimation. Connected by high-speed networking, our system supports flexible frame rates up to 120 FPS and guarantees high precision and real-time tracking on low-end devices. Both simulations and real world experiments show that our method achieves accurate and robust object tracking.

As the market penetration of CPS is growing, the intelligent distribution of the limited communication resources becomes more and more challenging. To address this problem, the ETSI CPS proposes dynamic-based object selection to generate Collective Perception Messages. However, this approach has limits and barely considers detection accuracy and the recent information available at other ITS-Ss in the transmission range. We show a proposal considering the current object tracking accuracy in the local environment and the object tracking from messages received by other stations in order to intelligently decide whether to include an object in a CPM. The algorithm decides based on the relative entropy between the local and V2X tracking accuracy if the object information is valuable for the nearby stations. Our simulation according to the ITS-G5 standard shows that the Channel Busy Ratio (CBR) can be reduced with accuracy-based generation of CPM while improving Object Tracking Accuracy (OTA) compared to generation based on ETSI rules.

Recent SLAM frameworks have been proposed to simultaneously track the camera and moving objects. However they are often unable to estimate the canonical pose of the objects and exhibit a low object tracking accuracy. To solve this problem we propose TwistSLAM++, a semantic, dynamic, SLAM system that fuses stereo images and LiDAR information. Using semantic information, we track potentially moving objects and associate them to 3D object detections in LiDAR scans to obtain their pose and size. Then, we perform registration on consecutive object scans to refine object pose estimation. Finally, object scans are used to estimate the shape of the object and constrain map points to lie on the estimated surface within the BA. We show on classical benchmarks that this fusion approach based on multimodal information improves the accuracy of object tracking.

Particularly for densely occupied scenes, associating existing tracks to new detections remains challenging as existing systems tend to omit critical contextual information. Our proposed solution, InterTrack, introduces the Interaction Transformer for 3D MOT to generate discriminative object representations for data association. We extract state and shape features for each track and detection, and efficiently aggregate global information via attention. We then perform a learned regression on each track/detection feature pair to estimate affinities, and use a robust two-stage data association and track management approach to produce the final tracks. We validate our approach on the nuScenes 3D MOT benchmark, where we observe significant improvements, particularly on classes with small physical sizes and clustered objects. As of submission, InterTrack ranks 1st in overall AMOTA among methods using CenterPoint detections.

Most methods can be roughly classified as tracking-by-detection and joint-detection-association paradigms.

However, the study of the fundamental event data association problem is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a novel Event Data Association (called EDA) approach to explicitly address the event association and fusion problem. The proposed EDA seeks for event trajectories that best fit the event data, in order to perform unifying data association and information fusion. In EDA, we first asynchronously fuse the event data based on its information entropy. Then, we introduce a deterministic model hypothesis generation strategy, which effectively generates model hypotheses from the fused events, to represent the corresponding event trajectories. After that, we present a two-stage weighting algorithm, which robustly weighs and selects true models from the generated model hypotheses, through multi-structural geometric model fitting. Meanwhile, we also propose an adaptive model selection strategy to automatically determine the number of the true models. Finally, we use the selected true models to associate and fuse the event data, without being affected by sensor noise and irrelevant structures. We evaluate the performance of the proposed EDA on the object tracking task. The experimental results show the effectiveness of EDA under challenging scenarios, such as high speed, motion blur, and high dynamic range conditions.

While current learned visual data association methods outperform hand-crafted algorithms, many rely on large collections of domain-specific training examples that can be difficult to obtain without prior knowledge. Additionally, such methods often remain fixed during inference-time and do not harness observed information to better their performance. We propose a self-supervised method for incrementally refining visual descriptors to improve performance in the task of object-level visual data association. Our method optimizes deep descriptor generators online, by continuously training a widely available image classification network pre-trained with domain-independent data. We show that earlier layers in the network outperform later-stage layers for the data association task while also allowing for a 94% reduction in the number of parameters, enabling the online optimization. We show that self-labelling challenging triplets--choosing positive examples separated by large temporal distances and negative examples close in the descriptor space--improves the quality of the learned descriptors for the multi-object tracking task. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses other visual data-association methods applied to a tracking-by-detection task, and show that it provides better performance-gains when compared to other methods that attempt to adapt to observed information.

Although great progress has been made in improving the accuracy of object detection in recent years due to the rise of deep neural networks, the state-of-the-art algorithms are highly computationally intensive. In order to address this challenge, we make two important observations in the context of videos: (i) Objects often occupy only a small fraction of the area in each video frame, and (ii) There is a high likelihood of strong temporal correlation between consecutive frames. Based on these observations, we propose Pack and Detect (PaD), an approach to reduce the computational requirements of object detection in videos. In PaD, only selected video frames called anchor frames are processed at full size. In the frames that lie between anchor frames (inter-anchor frames), regions of interest (ROIs) are identified based on the detections in the previous frame. We propose an algorithm to pack the ROIs of each inter-anchor frame together into a reduced-size frame. The computational requirements of the detector are reduced due to the lower size of the input. In order to maintain the accuracy of object detection, the proposed algorithm expands the ROIs greedily to provide additional background around each object to the detector. PaD can use any underlying neural network architecture to process the full-size and reduced-size frames. Experiments using the ImageNet video object detection dataset indicate that PaD can potentially reduce the number of FLOPS required for a frame by $4\times$. This leads to an overall increase in throughput of $1.25\times$ on a 2.1 GHz Intel Xeon server with a NVIDIA Titan X GPU at the cost of $1.1\%$ drop in accuracy.

This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation. Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a direct one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon controls, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally, visual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and inaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to capture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a significant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and regression-based models in the existing literature.
  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic hands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193 subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset incorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model, addressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three baseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a novel diffusion-based regression model for predicting tendon control from sEMG recordings. This dataset and modeling framework marks a significant step forward for tendon-driven dexterous robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork for scalable and accurate tendon control in robotic hands. https://emg2tendon.github.io/

It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated. In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14 distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness, but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3) The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and real-world benchmarks.

Existing approaches often struggle to balance accuracy and speed, particularly in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages advanced spatial-temporal modeling techniques for simultaneous action recognition and object tracking. Our approach builds upon recent advances in parallel sequence modeling and introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant spatial regions across temporal sequences. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and MOT17 datasets show improvements of 3.2% in action recognition accuracy and 2.8% in tracking precision compared to existing methods, with 40% faster inference time.

For this purpose, we consider the Delaunay triangulation of template features as an useful tool through which to be guided in this iterative approach. The triangulation is treated as a graph and, starting from a single triangle, neighboring nodes are considered and the corresponding features are identified; then matches related to them are evaluated to determine if they are worthy to be grouped. This evaluation is based on local consistency criteria derived from geometric and photometric properties of local features. Our solution allows the identification of the object in situations where geometric models (e.g. homography) does not hold, thus enable the detection of objects such that the template is non planar or when it is planar but appears distorted in the image. We show that our approach performs just as well or better than application of homography-based RANSAC in scenarios in which distortion is nearly absent, while when the deformation becomes relevant our method shows better description performance.

The rise of deep learning has significantly advanced MOT, particularly within the tracking-by-detection paradigm, which remains the dominant approach. Advancements in modern deep learning-based methods accelerated in 2022 with the introduction of ByteTrack for tracking-by-detection and MOTR for end-to-end tracking. Our survey provides an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based MOT methods, systematically categorizing tracking-by-detection approaches into five groups: joint detection and embedding, heuristic-based, motion-based, affinity learning, and offline methods. In addition, we examine end-to-end tracking methods and compare them with existing alternative approaches. We evaluate the performance of recent trackers across multiple benchmarks and specifically assess their generality by comparing results across different domains. Our findings indicate that heuristic-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results on densely populated datasets with linear object motion, while deep learning-based association methods, in both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end approaches, excel in scenarios with complex motion patterns.

These changes can affect the performance of systems used in echo cancellation and active acoustics and support tasks such as navigation and object tracking. Recognizing and quantifying such changes is, therefore, critical for advancing technologies based on room acoustics. This study introduces a method for analyzing acoustic environment changes by evaluating the similarity of consecutively recorded RIRs. Short-time coherence is employed to characterize modifications, including changes in wall absorption or the presence of a moving person in the room. A sensitivity rating is further used to quantify the magnitude of these changes. The results clearly differentiate between types of modifications -- atmospheric variation, changes in absorption, and human presence. The methods described provide a novel approach to analyzing and interpreting room acoustics, emphasizing RIR similarity and extracting information from temporal and spectral signal properties.

Our method learns object representations that are shared across segmentation, monocular depth estimation, and object tracking subtasks. In contrast to recent unified approaches that progressively refine a common object representation, we propose a hybrid method using task-specific branches within each decoder block, ultimately fusing them into a shared representation at the block interfaces. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes-DVPS and SemKITTI-DVPS datasets demonstrate that Multiformer achieves state-of-the-art performance across all DVPS metrics, outperforming previous methods by substantial margins. With a ResNet-50 backbone, Multiformer surpasses the previous best result by 3.0 DVPQ points while also improving depth estimation accuracy. Using a Swin-B backbone, Multiformer further improves performance by 4.0 DVPQ points. Multiformer also provides valuable insights into the design of multi-task decoder architectures.

Most existing methods rely on the spatial-temporal motion features and appearance embedding features of the detected objects in consecutive frames. Effectively and robustly representing the spatial and appearance features of long trajectories has become a critical factor affecting the performance of MOT. We propose a novel approach for appearance and spatial-temporal motion feature representation, improving upon the hierarchical clustering association method MOT FCG. For spatialtemporal motion features, we first propose Diagonal Modulated GIoU, which more accurately represents the relationship between the position and shape of the objects. Second, Mean Constant Velocity Modeling is proposed to reduce the effect of observation noise on target motion state estimation. For appearance features, we utilize a dynamic appearance representation that incorporates confidence information, enabling the trajectory appearance features to be more robust and global. Based on the baseline model MOT FCG, we have realized further improvements in the performance of all. we achieved 63.1 HOTA, 76.9 MOTA and 78.2 IDF1 on the MOT17 test set, and also achieved competitive performance on the MOT20 and DanceTrack sets.

We explore the application of a packing algorithm to solve the problem of video synopsis. Since the nature of the data is three dimensional, we consider 3D packing problems in the discussion. This paper also provides an extensive literature review of different video synopsis methods and packing problems. Lastly, we examine the different applications of this algorithm and how the different data representations discussed earlier can make the problem simpler. We also discuss the future directions of research that can be explored following this discussion.

In the literature, lots of good approaches based on sparse representation have already been presented to tackle the above problems. However, most of the algorithms do not focus on the learning of sparse representation. They only consider the modeling of target appearance and therefore drift away from the target with the imprecise training samples. By considering all the above factors in mind, we have proposed a visual object tracking algorithm by integrating a coarse-to-fine search strategy based on sparse representation and the weighted multiple instance learning (WMIL) algorithm. Compared with the other trackers, our approach has more information of the original signal with less complexity due to the coarse-to-fine search method, and also has weights for important samples. Thus, it can easily discriminate the background features from the foreground. Furthermore, we have also selected the samples from the un-occluded sub-regions to efficiently develop the strong classifier. As a consequence, a stable and robust object tracker is achieved to tackle all the aforementioned problems. Experimental results with quantitative as well as qualitative analysis on challenging benchmark datasets show the accuracy and efficiency of our method.

In recent years, numerous outstanding research works have proposed effective solutions for the localization problem. However, there has been a scarcity of excellent works focusing on constructing long-term consistent maps in dynamic scenes, which severely hampers map applications. To address this issue, we have designed a multi-level map construction system tailored for dynamic scenes.

We propose a plane map construction algorithm specialized for dynamic scenes, involving the extraction, filtering, data association, and fusion optimization of planes in dynamic environments, thus creating a plane map. Additionally, we introduce an object map construction algorithm targeted at dynamic scenes, which includes object parameterization, data association, and update optimization. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world scenarios validate the accuracy of the multi-level maps constructed in this study and the robustness of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical application prospects of our algorithms by utilizing the constructed object maps for dynamic object tracking.

For Dou Yin's homogenized videos, the proposed contour features achieve retrieval accuracy higher than 97% in Top1 return mode. For videos from Kinetics 700, the contour feature also showed good robustness for partial clip mode video tracing.

Without trusted third parties, their execution is not controlled by entities exercising centralized coordination but is instead realized through technologies supporting distribution such as blockchains and serverless computing. Executing decentralized applications with these technologies, however, is challenging due to the limited transparency and insight in the execution, especially when involving centralized cloud platforms. This paper extends an approach for execution and instance tracking on blockchains and cloud platforms permitting distributed parties to observe the instances and states of executable models. The approach is extended with (1.) a metamodel describing the concepts for instance tracking on cloud platforms independent of concrete models or implementation, (2.) a multidimensional data model realizing the concepts accordingly, permitting the verifiable storage, tracking, and analysis of execution states for distributed parties, and (3.) an implementation on the Ethereum blockchain and Amazon Web Services (AWS) using state machine models. Towards supporting decentralized applications with high scalability and distribution requirements, the approach establishes a consistent view on instances for distributed parties to track and analyze the execution along multiple dimensions such as specific clients and execution engines.

We note that tracking by detection may suffer from errors generated by noise detectors, such as an imprecise bounding box before the occlusions, and observed that in most tracking scenarios, objects tend to move and lost within specific locations. To counter this, we present a novel tracker to deal with the bad detector and occlusions. Firstly, we proposed a location-wise sub-region recognition method which equally divided the frame, which we called mesh. Then we proposed corresponding location-wise loss management strategies and different matching strategies. The resulting Mesh-SORT, ablation studies demonstrate its effectiveness and made 3% fragmentation 7.2% ID switches drop and 0.4% MOTA improvement compared to the baseline on MOT17 datasets. Finally, we analyze its limitation on the specific scene and discussed what future works can be extended.

</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2302.02622">Uncertainty Calibration and its Application to Object Detection</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>Image-based environment perception is an important component especially for driver assistance systems or autonomous driving. In this scope, modern neuronal networks are used to identify multiple objects as well as the according position and size information within a single frame. The performance of such an object detection model is important for the overall performance of the whole system. However, a detection model might also predict these objects under a certain degree of uncertainty. [...]
  In this work, we examine the semantic uncertainty (which object type?) as well as the spatial uncertainty (where is the object and how large is it?). We evaluate if the predicted uncertainties of an object detection model match with the observed error that is achieved on real-world data. In the first part of this work, we introduce the definition for confidence calibration of the semantic uncertainty in the context of object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. We integrate additional position information in our examinations to evaluate the effect of the object's position on the semantic calibration properties. Besides measuring calibration, it is also possible to perform a post-hoc recalibration of semantic uncertainty that might have turned out to be miscalibrated. [...]
  The second part of this work deals with the spatial uncertainty obtained by a probabilistic detection model. [...] We review and extend common calibration methods so that it is possible to obtain parametric uncertainty distributions for the position information in a more flexible way.
  In the last part, we demonstrate a possible use-case for our derived calibration methods in the context of object tracking. [...] We integrate our previously proposed calibration techniques and demonstrate the usefulness of semantic and spatial uncertainty calibration in a subsequent process. [...]
